1,Towards Integrated Glance To Restructuring in Combinatorial Optimization,"The paper focuses on a new class of combinatorial problems which consists in restructuring of solutions (as sets/structures) in combinatorial optimization. Two main features of the restructuring process are examined: (i) a cost of the restructuring, (ii) a closeness to a goal solution. Three types of the restructuring problems are under study: (a) one-stage structuring, (b) multi-stage structuring, and (c) structuring over changed element set. One-criterion and multicriteria problem formulations can be considered. The restructuring problems correspond to redesign (improvement, upgrade) of modular systems or solutions. The restructuring approach is described and illustrated (problem statements, solving schemes, examples) for the following combinatorial optimization problems: knapsack problem, multiple choice problem, assignment problem, spanning tree problems, clustering problem, multicriteria ranking (sorting) problem, morphological clique problem. Numerical examples illustrate the restructuring problems and solving schemes.",cs,AI,2015,How can the restructuring of solutions in combinatorial optimization be effectively modeled and solved to balance the costs of restructuring with the proximity to a desired goal solution across various problem types?
2,"Simple, Robust and Optimal Ranking from Pairwise Comparisons","We consider data in the form of pairwise comparisons of n items, with the goal of precisely identifying the top k items for some value of k < n, or alternatively, recovering a ranking of all the items. We analyze the Copeland counting algorithm that ranks the items in order of the number of pairwise comparisons won, and show it has three attractive features: (a) its computational efficiency leads to speed-ups of several orders of magnitude in computation time as compared to prior work; (b) it is robust in that theoretical guarantees impose no conditions on the underlying matrix of pairwise-comparison probabilities, in contrast to some prior work that applies only to the BTL parametric model; and (c) it is an optimal method up to constant factors, meaning that it achieves the information-theoretic limits for recovering the top k-subset. We extend our results to obtain sharp guarantees for approximate recovery under the Hamming distortion metric, and more generally, to any arbitrary error requirement that satisfies a simple and natural monotonicity condition.",cs,LG,2015,How can the Copeland counting algorithm be effectively utilized to achieve optimal ranking of items from pairwise comparisons while ensuring computational efficiency and robustness against varying data conditions?
3,Cutting-off Redundant Repeating Generations for Neural Abstractive Summarization,This paper tackles the reduction of redundant repeating generation that is often observed in RNN-based encoder-decoder models. Our basic idea is to jointly estimate the upper-bound frequency of each target vocabulary in the encoder and control the output words based on the estimation in the decoder. Our method shows significant improvement over a strong RNN-based encoder-decoder baseline and achieved its best results on an abstractive summarization benchmark.,cs,CL,2016,How can the estimation of target vocabulary frequency in RNN-based encoder-decoder models reduce redundancy in neural abstractive summarization outputs?
4,A Latent-class Model for Estimating Product-choice Probabilities from Clickstream Data,"This paper analyzes customer product-choice behavior based on the recency and frequency of each customer's page views on e-commerce sites. Recently, we devised an optimization model for estimating product-choice probabilities that satisfy monotonicity, convexity, and concavity constraints with respect to recency and frequency. This shape-restricted model delivered high predictive performance even when there were few training samples. However, typical e-commerce sites deal in many different varieties of products, so the predictive performance of the model can be further improved by integration of such product heterogeneity. For this purpose, we develop a novel latent-class shape-restricted model for estimating product-choice probabilities for each latent class of products. We also give a tailored expectation-maximization algorithm for parameter estimation. Computational results demonstrate that higher predictive performance is achieved with our latent-class model than with the previous shape-restricted model and common latent-class logistic regression.",cs,AI,2016,How can a latent-class shape-restricted model enhance the estimation of product-choice probabilities in e-commerce by incorporating product heterogeneity?
5,Report: Dynamic Eye Movement Matching and Visualization Tool in Neuro Gesture,"In the research of the impact of gestures using by a lecturer, one challenging task is to infer the attention of a group of audiences. Two important measurements that can help infer the level of attention are eye movement data and Electroencephalography (EEG) data. Under the fundamental assumption that a group of people would look at the same place if they all pay attention at the same time, we apply a method, ""Time Warp Edit Distance"", to calculate the similarity of their eye movement trajectories. Moreover, we also cluster eye movement pattern of audiences based on these pair-wised similarity metrics. Besides, since we don't have a direct metric for the ""attention"" ground truth, a visual assessment would be beneficial to evaluate the gesture-attention relationship. Thus we also implement a visualization tool.",cs,NE,2017,"How can the similarity of eye movement trajectories and EEG data be utilized to infer audience attention levels during a lecture, and what role does a visualization tool play in assessing the relationship between gestures and attention?"
6,Automated Conjecturing VII: The Graph Brain Project & Big Mathematics,"The Graph Brain Project is an experiment in how the use of automated mathematical discovery software, databases, large collaboration, and systematic investigation provide a model for how mathematical research might proceed in the future.   Our Project began with the development of a program that can be used to generate invariant-relation and property-relation conjectures in many areas of mathematics. This program can produce conjectures which are not implied by existing (published) theorems. Here we propose a new approach to push forward existing mathematical research goals---using automated mathematical discovery software. We suggest how to initiate and harness large-scale collaborative mathematics. We envision mathematical research labs similar to what exist in other sciences, new avenues for funding, new opportunities for training students, and a more efficient and effective use of published mathematical research.   And our experiment in graph theory can be imitated in many other areas of mathematical research. Big Mathematics is the idea of large, systematic, collaborative research on problems of existing mathematical interest. What is possible when we put our skills, tools, and results together systematically?",cs,AI,2017,How can automated mathematical discovery software and large-scale collaboration transform the process of conjecture generation and research in mathematics?
7,Attention-Based Capsule Networks with Dynamic Routing for Relation Extraction,"A capsule is a group of neurons, whose activity vector represents the instantiation parameters of a specific type of entity. In this paper, we explore the capsule networks used for relation extraction in a multi-instance multi-label learning framework and propose a novel neural approach based on capsule networks with attention mechanisms. We evaluate our method with different benchmarks, and it is demonstrated that our method improves the precision of the predicted relations. Particularly, we show that capsule networks improve multiple entity pairs relation extraction.",cs,IR,2018,How can attention-based capsule networks with dynamic routing enhance the precision of relation extraction in multi-instance multi-label learning frameworks?
8,ADMM-NN: An Algorithm-Hardware Co-Design Framework of DNNs Using Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers,"To facilitate efficient embedded and hardware implementations of deep neural networks (DNNs), two important categories of DNN model compression techniques: weight pruning and weight quantization are investigated. The former leverages the redundancy in the number of weights, whereas the latter leverages the redundancy in bit representation of weights. However, there lacks a systematic framework of joint weight pruning and quantization of DNNs, thereby limiting the available model compression ratio. Moreover, the computation reduction, energy efficiency improvement, and hardware performance overhead need to be accounted for besides simply model size reduction.   To address these limitations, we present ADMM-NN, the first algorithm-hardware co-optimization framework of DNNs using Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), a powerful technique to deal with non-convex optimization problems with possibly combinatorial constraints. The first part of ADMM-NN is a systematic, joint framework of DNN weight pruning and quantization using ADMM. It can be understood as a smart regularization technique with regularization target dynamically updated in each ADMM iteration, thereby resulting in higher performance in model compression than prior work. The second part is hardware-aware DNN optimizations to facilitate hardware-level implementations.   Without accuracy loss, we can achieve 85$\times$ and 24$\times$ pruning on LeNet-5 and AlexNet models, respectively, significantly higher than prior work. The improvement becomes more significant when focusing on computation reductions. Combining weight pruning and quantization, we achieve 1,910$\times$ and 231$\times$ reductions in overall model size on these two benchmarks, when focusing on data storage. Highly promising results are also observed on other representative DNNs such as VGGNet and ResNet-50.",cs,LG,2018,"How can the joint optimization of weight pruning and quantization in deep neural networks, using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, enhance model compression while maintaining hardware efficiency and performance?"
9,Feature-Attention Graph Convolutional Networks for Noise Resilient Learning,"Noise and inconsistency commonly exist in real-world information networks, due to inherent error-prone nature of human or user privacy concerns. To date, tremendous efforts have been made to advance feature learning from networks, including the most recent Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) or attention GCN, by integrating node content and topology structures. However, all existing methods consider networks as error-free sources and treat feature content in each node as independent and equally important to model node relations. The erroneous node content, combined with sparse features, provide essential challenges for existing methods to be used on real-world noisy networks. In this paper, we propose FA-GCN, a feature-attention graph convolution learning framework, to handle networks with noisy and sparse node content. To tackle noise and sparse content in each node, FA-GCN first employs a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to learn dense representation for each feature. To model interactions between neighboring nodes, a feature-attention mechanism is introduced to allow neighboring nodes learn and vary feature importance, with respect to their connections. By using spectral-based graph convolution aggregation process, each node is allowed to concentrate more on the most determining neighborhood features aligned with the corresponding learning task. Experiments and validations, w.r.t. different noise levels, demonstrate that FA-GCN achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods on both noise-free and noisy networks.",cs,LG,2019,How can feature-attention mechanisms in graph convolutional networks be effectively utilized to improve learning resilience in the presence of noisy and sparse node content in real-world information networks?
10,Uncertainty-Based Out-of-Distribution Classification in Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) data is an important goal in building reliable machine learning systems. Especially in autonomous systems, wrong predictions for OOD inputs can cause safety critical situations. As a first step towards a solution, we consider the problem of detecting such data in a value-based deep reinforcement learning (RL) setting. Modelling this problem as a one-class classification problem, we propose a framework for uncertainty-based OOD classification: UBOOD. It is based on the effect that an agent's epistemic uncertainty is reduced for situations encountered during training (in-distribution), and thus lower than for unencountered (OOD) situations. Being agnostic towards the approach used for estimating epistemic uncertainty, combinations with different uncertainty estimation methods, e.g. approximate Bayesian inference methods or ensembling techniques are possible. We further present a first viable solution for calculating a dynamic classification threshold, based on the uncertainty distribution of the training data. Evaluation shows that the framework produces reliable classification results when combined with ensemble-based estimators, while the combination with concrete dropout-based estimators fails to reliably detect OOD situations. In summary, UBOOD presents a viable approach for OOD classification in deep RL settings by leveraging the epistemic uncertainty of the agent's value function.",cs,LG,2019,How can epistemic uncertainty be effectively utilized to improve out-of-distribution classification in value-based deep reinforcement learning systems?
11,Out of Order: How Important Is The Sequential Order of Words in a Sentence in Natural Language Understanding Tasks?,"Do state-of-the-art natural language understanding models care about word order - one of the most important characteristics of a sequence? Not always! We found 75% to 90% of the correct predictions of BERT-based classifiers, trained on many GLUE tasks, remain constant after input words are randomly shuffled. Despite BERT embeddings are famously contextual, the contribution of each individual word to downstream tasks is almost unchanged even after the word's context is shuffled. BERT-based models are able to exploit superficial cues (e.g. the sentiment of keywords in sentiment analysis; or the word-wise similarity between sequence-pair inputs in natural language inference) to make correct decisions when tokens are arranged in random orders. Encouraging classifiers to capture word order information improves the performance on most GLUE tasks, SQuAD 2.0 and out-of-samples. Our work suggests that many GLUE tasks are not challenging machines to understand the meaning of a sentence.",cs,CL,2020,To what extent does the sequential order of words in a sentence influence the performance of BERT-based classifiers in natural language understanding tasks?
12,Fairness-Oriented User Scheduling for Bursty Downlink Transmission Using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,"In this work, we develop practical user scheduling algorithms for downlink bursty traffic with emphasis on user fairness. In contrast to the conventional scheduling algorithms that either equally divides the transmission time slots among users or maximizing some ratios without physcial meanings, we propose to use the 5%-tile user data rate (5TUDR) as the metric to evaluate user fairness. Since it is difficult to directly optimize 5TUDR, we first cast the problem into the stochastic game framework and subsequently propose a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)-based algorithm to perform distributed optimization on the resource block group (RBG) allocation. Furthermore, each MARL agent is designed to take information measured by network counters from multiple network layers (e.g. Channel Quality Indicator, Buffer size) as the input states while the RBG allocation as action with a proposed reward function designed to maximize 5TUDR. Extensive simulation is performed to show that the proposed MARL-based scheduler can achieve fair scheduling while maintaining good average network throughput as compared to conventional schedulers.",cs,OS,2020,How can Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning be effectively utilized to optimize user scheduling for bursty downlink transmission while ensuring fairness as measured by the 5%-tile user data rate?
13,An Efficient Federated Distillation Learning System for Multi-task Time Series Classification,"This paper proposes an efficient federated distillation learning system (EFDLS) for multi-task time series classification (TSC). EFDLS consists of a central server and multiple mobile users, where different users may run different TSC tasks. EFDLS has two novel components, namely a feature-based student-teacher (FBST) framework and a distance-based weights matching (DBWM) scheme. Within each user, the FBST framework transfers knowledge from its teacher's hidden layers to its student's hidden layers via knowledge distillation, with the teacher and student having identical network structure. For each connected user, its student model's hidden layers' weights are uploaded to the EFDLS server periodically. The DBWM scheme is deployed on the server, with the least square distance used to measure the similarity between the weights of two given models. This scheme finds a partner for each connected user such that the user's and its partner's weights are the closest among all the weights uploaded. The server exchanges and sends back the user's and its partner's weights to these two users which then load the received weights to their teachers' hidden layers. Experimental results show that the proposed EFDLS achieves excellent performance on a set of selected UCR2018 datasets regarding top-1 accuracy.",cs,LG,2021,How can an efficient federated distillation learning system improve multi-task time series classification performance across different mobile users?
14,Importance of Empirical Sample Complexity Analysis for Offline Reinforcement Learning,"We hypothesize that empirically studying the sample complexity of offline reinforcement learning (RL) is crucial for the practical applications of RL in the real world. Several recent works have demonstrated the ability to learn policies directly from offline data. In this work, we ask the question of the dependency on the number of samples for learning from offline data. Our objective is to emphasize that studying sample complexity for offline RL is important, and is an indicator of the usefulness of existing offline algorithms. We propose an evaluation approach for sample complexity analysis of offline RL.",cs,LG,2021,How does the sample complexity of offline reinforcement learning influence the effectiveness and applicability of existing offline algorithms in real-world scenarios?
15,"UBIWEAR: An end-to-end, data-driven framework for intelligent physical activity prediction to empower mHealth interventions","It is indisputable that physical activity is vital for an individual's health and wellness. However, a global prevalence of physical inactivity has induced significant personal and socioeconomic implications. In recent years, a significant amount of work has showcased the capabilities of self-tracking technology to create positive health behavior change. This work is motivated by the potential of personalized and adaptive goal-setting techniques in encouraging physical activity via self-tracking. To this end, we propose UBIWEAR, an end-to-end framework for intelligent physical activity prediction, with the ultimate goal to empower data-driven goal-setting interventions. To achieve this, we experiment with numerous machine learning and deep learning paradigms as a robust benchmark for physical activity prediction tasks. To train our models, we utilize, ""MyHeart Counts"", an open, large-scale dataset collected in-the-wild from thousands of users. We also propose a prescriptive framework for self-tracking aggregated data preprocessing, to facilitate data wrangling of real-world, noisy data. Our best model achieves a MAE of 1087 steps, 65% lower than the state of the art in terms of absolute error, proving the feasibility of the physical activity prediction task, and paving the way for future research.",cs,AI,2022,"How can an end-to-end, data-driven framework enhance the accuracy of physical activity prediction to support personalized mHealth interventions?"
16,Image Embedding for Denoising Generative Models,"Denoising Diffusion models are gaining increasing popularity in the field of generative modeling for several reasons, including the simple and stable training, the excellent generative quality, and the solid probabilistic foundation. In this article, we address the problem of {\em embedding} an image into the latent space of Denoising Diffusion Models, that is finding a suitable ``noisy'' image whose denoising results in the original image. We particularly focus on Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models due to the deterministic nature of their reverse diffusion process. As a side result of our investigation, we gain a deeper insight into the structure of the latent space of diffusion models, opening interesting perspectives on its exploration, the definition of semantic trajectories, and the manipulation/conditioning of encodings for editing purposes. A particularly interesting property highlighted by our research, which is also characteristic of this class of generative models, is the independence of the latent representation from the networks implementing the reverse diffusion process. In other words, a common seed passed to different networks (each trained on the same dataset), eventually results in identical images.",cs,CV,2022,How can images be effectively embedded into the latent space of Denoising Diffusion Models to ensure that the denoising process accurately reconstructs the original image?
17,Reviving the Context: Camera Trap Species Classification as Link Prediction on Multimodal Knowledge Graphs,"Camera traps are important tools in animal ecology for biodiversity monitoring and conservation. However, their practical application is limited by issues such as poor generalization to new and unseen locations. Images are typically associated with diverse forms of context, which may exist in different modalities. In this work, we exploit the structured context linked to camera trap images to boost out-of-distribution generalization for species classification tasks in camera traps. For instance, a picture of a wild animal could be linked to details about the time and place it was captured, as well as structured biological knowledge about the animal species. While often overlooked by existing studies, incorporating such context offers several potential benefits for better image understanding, such as addressing data scarcity and enhancing generalization. However, effectively incorporating such heterogeneous context into the visual domain is a challenging problem. To address this, we propose a novel framework that transforms species classification as link prediction in a multimodal knowledge graph (KG). This framework enables the seamless integration of diverse multimodal contexts for visual recognition. We apply this framework for out-of-distribution species classification on the iWildCam2020-WILDS and Snapshot Mountain Zebra datasets and achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, our framework enhances sample efficiency for recognizing under-represented species.",cs,CV,2023,How can the integration of multimodal contextual information in a knowledge graph improve out-of-distribution generalization for species classification in camera trap images?
18,"A Survey of Personality, Persona, and Profile in Conversational Agents and Chatbots","We present a review of personality in neural conversational agents (CAs), also called chatbots. First, we define Personality, Persona, and Profile. We explain all personality schemes which have been used in CAs, and list models under the scheme(s) which they use. Second we describe 21 datasets which have been developed in recent CA personality research. Third, we define the methods used to embody personality in a CA, and review recent models using them. Fourth, we survey some relevant reviews on CAs, personality, and related topics. Finally, we draw conclusions and identify some research challenges for this important emerging field.",cs,CL,2023,"How can personality be effectively embodied in conversational agents, and what are the current challenges and methodologies in the development of personality models for chatbots?"
19,Fuzzy Model Identification and Self Learning with Smooth Compositions,"This paper develops a smooth model identification and self-learning strategy for dynamic systems taking into account possible parameter variations and uncertainties. We have tried to solve the problem such that the model follows the changes and variations in the system on a continuous and smooth surface. Running the model to adaptively gain the optimum values of the parameters on a smooth surface would facilitate further improvements in the application of other derivative based optimization control algorithms such as MPC or robust control algorithms to achieve a combined modeling-control scheme. Compared to the earlier works on the smooth fuzzy modeling structures, we could reach a desired trade-off between the model optimality and the computational load. The proposed method has been evaluated on a test problem as well as the non-linear dynamic of a chemical process.",eess,SY,2024,"How can a smooth model identification and self-learning strategy be effectively developed to adapt to parameter variations and uncertainties in dynamic systems, while optimizing computational efficiency and enhancing the performance of derivative-based control algorithms?"
20,Re-evaluating Automatic LLM System Ranking for Alignment with Human Preference,"Evaluating and ranking the capabilities of different LLMs is crucial for understanding their performance and alignment with human preferences. Due to the high cost and time-consuming nature of human evaluations, an automatic LLM bencher (i.e., an automatic evaluation framework that aims to rank LLMs based on their alignment with human preferences) is indispensable. An automatic LLM bencher consists of four components: the input set (e.g., a user instruction), the evaluation model (e.g., an LLM), the evaluation type (e.g., pairwise comparison), and the aggregation method (e.g., the ELO rating system). However, previous work has not thoroughly explored how to select these components or how their different combinations influence the results. In this work, through controlled experiments, we provide a series of recommendations on how to choose each component to better automate the evaluation of LLMs. Furthermore, we discovered that when evaluating LLMs with similar performance, the performance of the automatic LLM bencher declines sharply, underscoring the limitations of current benchers and calling for future work. Lastly, we found that the evaluation models' performance at the instance level (e.g., the accuracy of selecting the best output) does not always align with their effectiveness when used as a component of a bencher, highlighting the importance of dedicated system-level evaluation of benchers.",cs,CL,2024,How can the selection and combination of components in an automatic LLM evaluation framework be optimized to improve alignment with human preferences and address performance limitations in ranking similar LLMs?
21,Architecture Is All You Need: Diversity-Enabled Sweet Spots for Robust Humanoid Locomotion,"Robust humanoid locomotion in unstructured environments requires architectures that balance fast low-level stabilization with slower perceptual decision-making. We show that a simple layered control architecture (LCA), a proprioceptive stabilizer running at high rate, coupled with a compact low-rate perceptual policy, enables substantially more robust performance than monolithic end-to-end designs, even when using minimal perception encoders. Through a two-stage training curriculum (blind stabilizer pretraining followed by perceptual fine-tuning), we demonstrate that layered policies consistently outperform one-stage alternatives in both simulation and hardware. On a Unitree G1 humanoid, our approach succeeds across stair and ledge tasks where one-stage perceptual policies fail. These results highlight that architectural separation of timescales, rather than network scale or complexity, is the key enabler for robust perception-conditioned locomotion.",cs,RO,2025,How does the separation of control architecture timescales influence the robustness of humanoid locomotion in unstructured environments compared to monolithic end-to-end designs?
22,Where to Search: Measure the Prior-Structured Search Space of LLM Agents,"The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language models (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program discovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable inferences and validate them via a majority-vote instantiation. This theory offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search constructed by LLMs.",cs,AI,2025,How can the operational structure of hypothesis spaces be effectively measured and optimized in LLM-assisted iterative search processes guided by domain priors?
23,An (MI)LP-based Primal Heuristic for 3-Architecture Connected Facility Location in Urban Access Network Design,"We investigate the 3-architecture Connected Facility Location Problem arising in the design of urban telecommunication access networks. We propose an original optimization model for the problem that includes additional variables and constraints to take into account wireless signal coverage. Since the problem can prove challenging even for modern state-of-the art optimization solvers, we propose to solve it by an original primal heuristic which combines a probabilistic fixing procedure, guided by peculiar Linear Programming relaxations, with an exact MIP heuristic, based on a very large neighborhood search. Computational experiments on a set of realistic instances show that our heuristic can find solutions associated with much lower optimality gaps than a state-of-the-art solver.",math,OC,2015,How can a primal heuristic combining probabilistic fixing and exact MIP techniques effectively optimize the 3-architecture Connected Facility Location Problem in urban telecommunication access network design while ensuring wireless signal coverage?
24,Modeling Progress in AI,"Participants in recent discussions of AI-related issues ranging from intelligence explosion to technological unemployment have made diverse claims about the nature, pace, and drivers of progress in AI. However, these theories are rarely specified in enough detail to enable systematic evaluation of their assumptions or to extrapolate progress quantitatively, as is often done with some success in other technological domains. After reviewing relevant literatures and justifying the need for more rigorous modeling of AI progress, this paper contributes to that research program by suggesting ways to account for the relationship between hardware speed increases and algorithmic improvements in AI, the role of human inputs in enabling AI capabilities, and the relationships between different sub-fields of AI. It then outlines ways of tailoring AI progress models to generate insights on the specific issue of technological unemployment, and outlines future directions for research on AI progress.",cs,AI,2015,"How can we systematically model the relationship between hardware advancements, algorithmic improvements, and human contributions to better understand and predict the progress of AI and its implications for technological unemployment?"
25,Device and System Level Design Considerations for Analog-Non-Volatile-Memory Based Neuromorphic Architectures,"This paper gives an overview of recent progress in the brain inspired computing field with a focus on implementation using emerging memories as electronic synapses. Design considerations and challenges such as requirements and design targets on multilevel states, device variability, programming energy, array-level connectivity, fan-in/fanout, wire energy, and IR drop are presented. Wires are increasingly important in design decisions, especially for large systems, and cycle-to-cycle variations have large impact on learning performance.",cs,NE,2015,"What are the key design considerations and challenges for implementing analog non-volatile memory in neuromorphic architectures, particularly regarding device variability, energy efficiency, and interconnect performance?"
26,From Virtual to Real World Visual Perception using Domain Adaptation -- The DPM as Example,"Supervised learning tends to produce more accurate classifiers than unsupervised learning in general. This implies that training data is preferred with annotations. When addressing visual perception challenges, such as localizing certain object classes within an image, the learning of the involved classifiers turns out to be a practical bottleneck. The reason is that, at least, we have to frame object examples with bounding boxes in thousands of images. A priori, the more complex the model is regarding its number of parameters, the more annotated examples are required. This annotation task is performed by human oracles, which ends up in inaccuracies and errors in the annotations (aka ground truth) since the task is inherently very cumbersome and sometimes ambiguous. As an alternative we have pioneered the use of virtual worlds for collecting such annotations automatically and with high precision. However, since the models learned with virtual data must operate in the real world, we still need to perform domain adaptation (DA). In this chapter we revisit the DA of a deformable part-based model (DPM) as an exemplifying case of virtual- to-real-world DA. As a use case, we address the challenge of vehicle detection for driver assistance, using different publicly available virtual-world data. While doing so, we investigate questions such as: how does the domain gap behave due to virtual-vs-real data with respect to dominant object appearance per domain, as well as the role of photo-realism in the virtual world.",cs,CV,2016,How can domain adaptation techniques effectively bridge the gap between virtual and real-world visual perception for accurate vehicle detection in driver assistance systems?
27,Deep neural heart rate variability analysis,"Despite of the pain and limited accuracy of blood tests for early recognition of cardiovascular disease, they dominate risk screening and triage. On the other hand, heart rate variability is non-invasive and cheap, but not considered accurate enough for clinical practice. Here, we tackle heart beat interval based classification with deep learning. We introduce an end to end differentiable hybrid architecture, consisting of a layer of biological neuron models of cardiac dynamics (modified FitzHugh Nagumo neurons) and several layers of a standard feed-forward neural network. The proposed model is evaluated on ECGs from 474 stable at-risk (coronary artery disease) patients, and 1172 chest pain patients of an emergency department. We show that it can significantly outperform models based on traditional heart rate variability predictors, as well as approaching or in some cases outperforming clinical blood tests, based only on 60 seconds of inter-beat intervals.",cs,NE,2016,How can a deep learning hybrid model utilizing biological neuron dynamics improve the accuracy of heart rate variability analysis for early cardiovascular disease detection compared to traditional methods and clinical blood tests?
28,PrASP Report,"This technical report describes the usage, syntax, semantics and core algorithms of the probabilistic inductive logic programming framework PrASP. PrASP is a research software which integrates non-monotonic reasoning based on Answer Set Programming (ASP), probabilistic inference and parameter learning. In contrast to traditional approaches to Probabilistic (Inductive) Logic Programming, our framework imposes only little restrictions on probabilistic logic programs. In particular, PrASP allows for ASP as well as First-Order Logic syntax, and for the annotation of formulas with point probabilities as well as interval probabilities. A range of widely configurable inference algorithms can be combined in a pipeline-like fashion, in order to cover a variety of use cases.",cs,AI,2016,"How does the PrASP framework enhance the capabilities of probabilistic inductive logic programming through its integration of non-monotonic reasoning, flexible syntax, and configurable inference algorithms?"
29,Fuzzy Constraints Linear Discriminant Analysis,In this paper we introduce a fuzzy constraint linear discriminant analysis (FC-LDA). The FC-LDA tries to minimize misclassification error based on modified perceptron criterion that benefits handling the uncertainty near the decision boundary by means of a fuzzy linear programming approach with fuzzy resources. The method proposed has low computational complexity because of its linear characteristics and the ability to deal with noisy data with different degrees of tolerance. Obtained results verify the success of the algorithm when dealing with different problems. Comparing FC-LDA and LDA shows superiority in classification task.,cs,AI,2016,How does the fuzzy constraint linear discriminant analysis (FC-LDA) improve classification accuracy and handle uncertainty compared to traditional linear discriminant analysis (LDA) in the presence of noisy data?
30,CSGNet: Neural Shape Parser for Constructive Solid Geometry,"We present a neural architecture that takes as input a 2D or 3D shape and outputs a program that generates the shape. The instructions in our program are based on constructive solid geometry principles, i.e., a set of boolean operations on shape primitives defined recursively. Bottom-up techniques for this shape parsing task rely on primitive detection and are inherently slow since the search space over possible primitive combinations is large. In contrast, our model uses a recurrent neural network that parses the input shape in a top-down manner, which is significantly faster and yields a compact and easy-to-interpret sequence of modeling instructions. Our model is also more effective as a shape detector compared to existing state-of-the-art detection techniques. We finally demonstrate that our network can be trained on novel datasets without ground-truth program annotations through policy gradient techniques.",cs,CV,2017,How can a top-down neural architecture improve the efficiency and effectiveness of shape parsing in Constructive Solid Geometry compared to traditional bottom-up techniques?
31,Multiagent-based Participatory Urban Simulation through Inverse Reinforcement Learning,"The multiagent-based participatory simulation features prominently in urban planning as the acquired model is considered as the hybrid system of the domain and the local knowledge. However, the key problem of generating realistic agents for particular social phenomena invariably remains. The existing models have attempted to dictate the factors involving human behavior, which appeared to be intractable. In this paper, Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) is introduced to address this problem. IRL is developed for computational modeling of human behavior and has achieved great successes in robotics, psychology and machine learning. The possibilities presented by this new style of modeling are drawn out as conclusions, and the relative challenges with this modeling are highlighted.",cs,MA,2017,How can Inverse Reinforcement Learning be effectively utilized to generate realistic agents that accurately model human behavior in multiagent-based participatory urban simulations?
32,"Whatever Does Not Kill Deep Reinforcement Learning, Makes It Stronger","Recent developments have established the vulnerability of deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) to policy manipulation attacks via adversarial perturbations. In this paper, we investigate the robustness and resilience of deep RL to training-time and test-time attacks. Through experimental results, we demonstrate that under noncontiguous training-time attacks, Deep Q-Network (DQN) agents can recover and adapt to the adversarial conditions by reactively adjusting the policy. Our results also show that policies learned under adversarial perturbations are more robust to test-time attacks. Furthermore, we compare the performance of $\epsilon$-greedy and parameter-space noise exploration methods in terms of robustness and resilience against adversarial perturbations.",cs,AI,2017,How do different exploration strategies in deep reinforcement learning influence the robustness and resilience of agents against adversarial perturbations during training and testing?
33,"Compare, Compress and Propagate: Enhancing Neural Architectures with Alignment Factorization for Natural Language Inference","This paper presents a new deep learning architecture for Natural Language Inference (NLI). Firstly, we introduce a new architecture where alignment pairs are compared, compressed and then propagated to upper layers for enhanced representation learning. Secondly, we adopt factorization layers for efficient and expressive compression of alignment vectors into scalar features, which are then used to augment the base word representations. The design of our approach is aimed to be conceptually simple, compact and yet powerful. We conduct experiments on three popular benchmarks, SNLI, MultiNLI and SciTail, achieving competitive performance on all. A lightweight parameterization of our model also enjoys a $\approx 3$ times reduction in parameter size compared to the existing state-of-the-art models, e.g., ESIM and DIIN, while maintaining competitive performance. Additionally, visual analysis shows that our propagated features are highly interpretable.",cs,CL,2017,How can alignment factorization be effectively utilized in deep learning architectures to enhance representation learning for Natural Language Inference while reducing model complexity and maintaining interpretability?
34,Interpretable Counting for Visual Question Answering,"Questions that require counting a variety of objects in images remain a major challenge in visual question answering (VQA). The most common approaches to VQA involve either classifying answers based on fixed length representations of both the image and question or summing fractional counts estimated from each section of the image. In contrast, we treat counting as a sequential decision process and force our model to make discrete choices of what to count. Specifically, the model sequentially selects from detected objects and learns interactions between objects that influence subsequent selections. A distinction of our approach is its intuitive and interpretable output, as discrete counts are automatically grounded in the image. Furthermore, our method outperforms the state of the art architecture for VQA on multiple metrics that evaluate counting.",cs,AI,2017,How can a sequential decision-making approach improve the interpretability and accuracy of counting objects in visual question answering tasks?
35,Advancing the State of the Art in Open Domain Dialog Systems through the Alexa Prize,"Building open domain conversational systems that allow users to have engaging conversations on topics of their choice is a challenging task. Alexa Prize was launched in 2016 to tackle the problem of achieving natural, sustained, coherent and engaging open-domain dialogs. In the second iteration of the competition in 2018, university teams advanced the state of the art by using context in dialog models, leveraging knowledge graphs for language understanding, handling complex utterances, building statistical and hierarchical dialog managers, and leveraging model-driven signals from user responses. The 2018 competition also included the provision of a suite of tools and models to the competitors including the CoBot (conversational bot) toolkit, topic and dialog act detection models, conversation evaluators, and a sensitive content detection model so that the competing teams could focus on building knowledge-rich, coherent and engaging multi-turn dialog systems. This paper outlines the advances developed by the university teams as well as the Alexa Prize team to achieve the common goal of advancing the science of Conversational AI. We address several key open-ended problems such as conversational speech recognition, open domain natural language understanding, commonsense reasoning, statistical dialog management, and dialog evaluation. These collaborative efforts have driven improved experiences by Alexa users to an average rating of 3.61, the median duration of 2 mins 18 seconds, and average turns to 14.6, increases of 14%, 92%, 54% respectively since the launch of the 2018 competition. For conversational speech recognition, we have improved our relative Word Error Rate by 55% and our relative Entity Error Rate by 34% since the launch of the Alexa Prize. Socialbots improved in quality significantly more rapidly in 2018, in part due to the release of the CoBot toolkit.",cs,CL,2018,"How have advancements in dialog models, knowledge integration, and evaluation tools contributed to the improvement of open-domain conversational systems in the Alexa Prize competition?"
36,Inorganic Materials Synthesis Planning with Literature-Trained Neural Networks,"Leveraging new data sources is a key step in accelerating the pace of materials design and discovery. To complement the strides in synthesis planning driven by historical, experimental, and computed data, we present an automated method for connecting scientific literature to synthesis insights. Starting from natural language text, we apply word embeddings from language models, which are fed into a named entity recognition model, upon which a conditional variational autoencoder is trained to generate syntheses for arbitrary materials. We show the potential of this technique by predicting precursors for two perovskite materials, using only training data published over a decade prior to their first reported syntheses. We demonstrate that the model learns representations of materials corresponding to synthesis-related properties, and that the model's behavior complements existing thermodynamic knowledge. Finally, we apply the model to perform synthesizability screening for proposed novel perovskite compounds.",cond-mat,mtrl-sci,2018,"How can neural networks trained on scientific literature be utilized to automate the synthesis planning of inorganic materials, specifically in predicting precursors and screening synthesizability for novel compounds?"
37,Entity Synonym Discovery via Multipiece Bilateral Context Matching,"Being able to automatically discover synonymous entities in an open-world setting benefits various tasks such as entity disambiguation or knowledge graph canonicalization. Existing works either only utilize entity features, or rely on structured annotations from a single piece of context where the entity is mentioned. To leverage diverse contexts where entities are mentioned, in this paper, we generalize the distributional hypothesis to a multi-context setting and propose a synonym discovery framework that detects entity synonyms from free-text corpora with considerations on effectiveness and robustness. As one of the key components in synonym discovery, we introduce a neural network model SYNONYMNET to determine whether or not two given entities are synonym with each other. Instead of using entities features, SYNONYMNET makes use of multiple pieces of contexts in which the entity is mentioned, and compares the context-level similarity via a bilateral matching schema. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model is able to detect synonym sets that are not observed during training on both generic and domain-specific datasets: Wiki+Freebase, PubMed+UMLS, and MedBook+MKG, with up to 4.16% improvement in terms of Area Under the Curve and 3.19% in terms of Mean Average Precision compared to the best baseline method.",cs,CL,2018,How can a multi-context approach improve the discovery of synonymous entities in free-text corpora compared to traditional methods that rely on single-context annotations?
38,A shortest-path based clustering algorithm for joint human-machine analysis of complex datasets,"Clustering is a technique for the analysis of datasets obtained by empirical studies in several disciplines with a major application for biomedical research. Essentially, clustering algorithms are executed by machines aiming at finding groups of related points in a dataset. However, the result of grouping depends on both metrics for point-to-point similarity and rules for point-to-group association. Indeed, non-appropriate metrics and rules can lead to undesirable clustering artifacts. This is especially relevant for datasets, where groups with heterogeneous structures co-exist. In this work, we propose an algorithm that achieves clustering by exploring the paths between points. This allows both, to evaluate the properties of the path (such as gaps, density variations, etc.), and expressing the preference for certain paths. Moreover, our algorithm supports the integration of existing knowledge about admissible and non-admissible clusters by training a path classifier. We demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method on challenging datasets including points from synthetic shapes in publicly available benchmarks and microscopy data.",q-bio,QM,2018,"How can a shortest-path based clustering algorithm improve the accuracy of group identification in complex datasets, particularly in the presence of heterogeneous structures?"
39,StarAlgo: A Squad Movement Planning Library for StarCraft using Monte Carlo Tree Search and Negamax,"Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games have recently become a popular testbed for artificial intelligence research. They represent a complex adversarial domain providing a number of interesting AI challenges. There exists a wide variety of research-supporting software tools, libraries and frameworks for one RTS game in particular -- StarCraft: Brood War. These tools are designed to address various specific sub-problems, such as resource allocation or opponent modelling so that researchers can focus exclusively on the tasks relevant to them. We present one such tool -- a library called StarAlgo that produces plans for the coordinated movement of squads (groups of combat units) within the game world. StarAlgo library can solve the squad movement planning problem using one of two algorithms: Monte Carlo Tree Search Considering Durations (MCTSCD) and a slightly modified version of Negamax. We evaluate both the algorithms, compare them, and demonstrate their usage. The library is implemented as a static C++ library that can be easily plugged into most StarCraft AI bots.",cs,AI,2018,How can the StarAlgo library improve squad movement planning in StarCraft using Monte Carlo Tree Search and Negamax algorithms?
40,Boldly Going Where No Prover Has Gone Before,"I argue that the most interesting goal facing researchers in automated reasoning is being able to solve problems that cannot currently be solved by existing tools and methods. This may appear obvious, and is clearly not an original thought, but focusing on this as a primary goal allows us to examine other goals in a new light. Many successful theorem provers employ a portfolio of different methods for solving problems. This changes the landscape on which we perform our research: solving problems that can already be solved may not improve the state of the art and a method that can solve a handful of problems unsolvable by current methods, but generally performs poorly on most problems, can be very useful. We acknowledge that forcing new methods to compete against portfolio solvers can stifle innovation. However, this is only the case when comparisons are made at the level of total problems solved. We propose a movement towards focussing on unique solutions in evaluation and competitions i.e. measuring the potential contribution to a portfolio solver. This state of affairs is particularly prominent in first-order logic, which is undecidable. When reasoning in a decidable logic there can be a focus on optimising a decision procedure and measuring average solving times. But in a setting where solutions are difficult to find, average solving times lose meaning, and whilst improving the efficiency of a technique can move potential solutions within acceptable time limits, in general, complementary strategies may be more successful.",cs,LO,2019,"How can the evaluation and development of automated reasoning methods be shifted to prioritize unique solutions that address previously unsolvable problems, rather than competing solely on total problems solved?"
41,The Limits of Efficiency for Open- and Closed-World Query Evaluation Under Guarded TGDs,"Ontology-mediated querying and querying in the presence of constraints are two key database problems where tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs) play a central role. In ontology-mediated querying, TGDs can formalize the ontology and thus derive additional facts from the given data, while in querying in the presence of constraints, they restrict the set of admissible databases. In this work, we study the limits of efficient query evaluation in the context of the above two problems, focussing on guarded and frontier-guarded TGDs and on UCQs as the actual queries. We show that a class of ontology-mediated queries (OMQs) based on guarded TGDs can be evaluated in FPT iff the OMQs in the class are equivalent to OMQs in which the actual query has bounded treewidth, up to some reasonable assumptions. For querying in the presence of constraints, we consider classes of constraint-query specifications (CQSs) that bundle a set of constraints with an actual query. We show a dichotomy result for CQSs based on guarded TGDs that parallels the one for OMQs except that, additionally, FPT coincides with PTime combined complexity. The proof is based on a novel connection between OMQ and CQS evaluation. Using a direct proof, we also show a similar dichotomy result, again up to some reasonable assumptions, for CQSs based on frontier-guarded TGDs with a bounded number of atoms in TGD heads. Our results on CQSs can be viewed as extensions of Grohe's well-known characterization of the tractable classes of CQs (without constraints). Like Grohe's characterization, all the above results assume that the arity of relation symbols is bounded by a constant. We also study the associated meta problems, i.e., whether a given OMQ or CQS is equivalent to one in which the actual query has bounded treewidth.",cs,DB,2019,"What are the conditions under which ontology-mediated queries and constraint-query specifications involving guarded and frontier-guarded tuple-generating dependencies can be evaluated efficiently, particularly in relation to treewidth and complexity classes?"
42,Evolutionary Clustering via Message Passing,"We are often interested in clustering objects that evolve over time and identifying solutions to the clustering problem for every time step. Evolutionary clustering provides insight into cluster evolution and temporal changes in cluster memberships while enabling performance superior to that achieved by independently clustering data collected at different time points. In this paper we introduce evolutionary affinity propagation (EAP), an evolutionary clustering algorithm that groups data points by exchanging messages on a factor graph. EAP promotes temporal smoothness of the solution to clustering time-evolving data by linking the nodes of the factor graph that are associated with adjacent data snapshots, and introduces consensus nodes to enable cluster tracking and identification of cluster births and deaths. Unlike existing evolutionary clustering methods that require additional processing to approximate the number of clusters or match them across time, EAP determines the number of clusters and tracks them automatically. A comparison with existing methods on simulated and experimental data demonstrates effectiveness of the proposed EAP algorithm.",cs,LG,2019,How can evolutionary affinity propagation (EAP) effectively track and identify clusters in time-evolving data while ensuring temporal smoothness and automatic determination of the number of clusters?
43,A Neurocomputational Account of Flexible Goal-directed Cognition and Consciousness: The Goal-Aligning Representation Internal Manipulation Theory (GARIM),"Goal-directed manipulation of representations is a key element of human flexible behaviour, while consciousness is often related to several aspects of higher-order cognition and human flexibility. Currently these two phenomena are only partially integrated (e.g., see Neurorepresentationalism) and this (a) limits our understanding of neuro-computational processes that lead conscious states to produce flexible goal-directed behaviours, (b) prevents a computational formalisation of conscious goal-directed manipulations of representations occurring in the brain, and (c) inhibits the exploitation of this knowledge for modelling and technological purposes. Addressing these issues, here we extend our `three-component theory of flexible cognition' by proposing the `Goal-Aligning Representations Internal Manipulation' (GARIM) theory of conscious and flexible goal-directed cognition. The central idea of the theory is that conscious states support the active manipulation of goal-relevant internal representations (e.g., of world states, objects, and action sequences) to make them more aligned with the pursued goals. This leads to the generation of the knowledge which is necessary to face novel situations/goals, thus increasing the flexibility of goal-directed behaviours. The GARIM theory integrates key aspects of the main theories of consciousness into the functional neuro-computational framework of goal-directed behaviour. Moreover, it takes into account the subjective sensation of agency that accompanies conscious goal-directed processes (`GARIM agency'). The proposal has also implications for experimental studies on consciousness and clinical aspects of conscious goal-directed behaviour. Finally, the GARIM theory benefit technological fields such as autonomous robotics and machine learning (e.g., the manipulation process may describe the operations performed by systems based on transformers).",cs,AI,2019,How does the Goal-Aligning Representations Internal Manipulation (GARIM) theory explain the neuro-computational processes that enable conscious states to facilitate flexible goal-directed behaviors?
44,Learning by Cheating,"Vision-based urban driving is hard. The autonomous system needs to learn to perceive the world and act in it. We show that this challenging learning problem can be simplified by decomposing it into two stages. We first train an agent that has access to privileged information. This privileged agent cheats by observing the ground-truth layout of the environment and the positions of all traffic participants. In the second stage, the privileged agent acts as a teacher that trains a purely vision-based sensorimotor agent. The resulting sensorimotor agent does not have access to any privileged information and does not cheat. This two-stage training procedure is counter-intuitive at first, but has a number of important advantages that we analyze and empirically demonstrate. We use the presented approach to train a vision-based autonomous driving system that substantially outperforms the state of the art on the CARLA benchmark and the recent NoCrash benchmark. Our approach achieves, for the first time, 100% success rate on all tasks in the original CARLA benchmark, sets a new record on the NoCrash benchmark, and reduces the frequency of infractions by an order of magnitude compared to the prior state of the art. For the video that summarizes this work, see https://youtu.be/u9ZCxxD-UUw",cs,RO,2019,"How can a two-stage training approach, utilizing a privileged agent with access to ground-truth information, enhance the performance of vision-based autonomous driving systems compared to traditional training methods?"
45,"Moral Stories: Situated Reasoning about Norms, Intents, Actions, and their Consequences","In social settings, much of human behavior is governed by unspoken rules of conduct. For artificial systems to be fully integrated into social environments, adherence to such norms is a central prerequisite. We investigate whether contemporary NLG models can function as behavioral priors for systems deployed in social settings by generating action hypotheses that achieve predefined goals under moral constraints. Moreover, we examine if models can anticipate likely consequences of (im)moral actions, or explain why certain actions are preferable by generating relevant norms. For this purpose, we introduce 'Moral Stories', a crowd-sourced dataset of structured, branching narratives for the study of grounded, goal-oriented social reasoning. Finally, we propose decoding strategies that effectively combine multiple expert models to significantly improve the quality of generated actions, consequences, and norms compared to strong baselines, e.g. though abductive reasoning.",cs,CL,2020,How can natural language generation models be utilized to understand and generate morally constrained actions and their consequences in social contexts?
46,Accurate Word Representations with Universal Visual Guidance,"Word representation is a fundamental component in neural language understanding models. Recently, pre-trained language models (PrLMs) offer a new performant method of contextualized word representations by leveraging the sequence-level context for modeling. Although the PrLMs generally give more accurate contextualized word representations than non-contextualized models do, they are still subject to a sequence of text contexts without diverse hints for word representation from multimodality. This paper thus proposes a visual representation method to explicitly enhance conventional word embedding with multiple-aspect senses from visual guidance. In detail, we build a small-scale word-image dictionary from a multimodal seed dataset where each word corresponds to diverse related images. The texts and paired images are encoded in parallel, followed by an attention layer to integrate the multimodal representations. We show that the method substantially improves the accuracy of disambiguation. Experiments on 12 natural language understanding and machine translation tasks further verify the effectiveness and the generalization capability of the proposed approach.",cs,CL,2020,How can integrating visual representations with contextualized word embeddings improve the accuracy of word disambiguation in neural language understanding models?
47,Learning to Optimize Energy Efficiency in Energy Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks,"We study wireless power transmission by an energy source to multiple energy harvesting nodes with the aim to maximize the energy efficiency. The source transmits energy to the nodes using one of the available power levels in each time slot and the nodes transmit information back to the energy source using the harvested energy. The source does not have any channel state information and it only knows whether a received codeword from a given node was successfully decoded or not. With this limited information, the source has to learn the optimal power level that maximizes the energy efficiency of the network. We model the problem as a stochastic Multi-Armed Bandits problem and develop an Upper Confidence Bound based algorithm, which learns the optimal transmit power of the energy source that maximizes the energy efficiency. Numerical results validate the performance guarantees of the proposed algorithm and show significant gains compared to the benchmark schemes.",eess,SP,2020,"How can an energy source optimally adjust its power transmission levels to maximize energy efficiency in energy harvesting wireless sensor networks, given the constraints of limited channel state information?"

49,Refine and Imitate: Reducing Repetition and Inconsistency in Persuasion Dialogues via Reinforcement Learning and Human Demonstration,"Persuasion dialogue systems reflect the machine's ability to make strategic moves beyond verbal communication, and therefore differentiate themselves from task-oriented or open-domain dialogue systems and have their own unique values. However, the repetition and inconsistency problems still persist in dialogue response generation and could substantially impact user experience and impede the persuasion outcome. Besides, although reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have achieved big success in strategic tasks such as games, they require a sophisticated user simulator to provide real-time feedback to the dialogue system, which limits the application of RL on persuasion dialogues. To address these issues towards a better persuasion dialogue system, we apply RL to refine a language model baseline without user simulators, and distill sentence-level information about repetition, inconsistency, and task relevance through rewards. Moreover, to better accomplish the persuasion task, the model learns from human demonstration to imitate human persuasion behavior and selects the most persuasive responses. Experiments show that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art dialogue models on both automatic metrics and human evaluation results on a donation persuasion task, and generates more diverse, consistent and persuasive conversations according to the user feedback.",cs,CL,2020,"How can reinforcement learning and human demonstration be effectively integrated to reduce repetition and inconsistency in persuasion dialogue systems, thereby enhancing their overall effectiveness and user experience?"

The current network operator methodologies and approaches are traditional and cannot help the next generation networks to utilize their resources most appropriately. The limited capability of the traditional tools will not allow the network providers to fulfill the demands of the network's subscribers in the future.

51,Robust Entropy-regularized Markov Decision Processes,"Stochastic and soft optimal policies resulting from entropy-regularized Markov decision processes (ER-MDP) are desirable for exploration and imitation learning applications. Motivated by the fact that such policies are sensitive with respect to the state transition probabilities, and the estimation of these probabilities may be inaccurate, we study a robust version of the ER-MDP model, where the stochastic optimal policies are required to be robust with respect to the ambiguity in the underlying transition probabilities. Our work is at the crossroads of two important schemes in reinforcement learning (RL), namely, robust MDP and entropy regularized MDP. We show that essential properties that hold for the non-robust ER-MDP and robust unregularized MDP models also hold in our settings, making the robust ER-MDP problem tractable. We show how our framework and results can be integrated into different algorithmic schemes including value or (modified) policy iteration, which would lead to new robust RL and inverse RL algorithms to handle uncertainties. Analyses on computational complexity and error propagation under conventional uncertainty settings are also provided.",cs,LG,2021,How can we develop robust entropy-regularized Markov decision processes that maintain optimal policies in the presence of uncertainty in state transition probabilities?
52,From Behavioral Theories to Econometrics: Inferring Preferences of Human Agents from Data on Repeated Interactions,"We consider the problem of estimating preferences of human agents from data of strategic systems where the agents repeatedly interact. Recently, it was demonstrated that a new estimation method called ""quantal regret"" produces more accurate estimates for human agents than the classic approach that assumes that agents are rational and reach a Nash equilibrium; however, this method has not been compared to methods that take into account behavioral aspects of human play. In this paper we leverage equilibrium concepts from behavioral economics for this purpose and ask how well they perform compared to the quantal regret and Nash equilibrium methods. We develop four estimation methods based on established behavioral equilibrium models to infer the utilities of human agents from observed data of normal-form games. The equilibrium models we study are quantal-response equilibrium, action-sampling equilibrium, payoff-sampling equilibrium, and impulse-balance equilibrium. We show that in some of these concepts the inference is achieved analytically via closed formulas, while in the others the inference is achieved only algorithmically. We use experimental data of 2x2 games to evaluate the estimation success of these behavioral equilibrium methods. The results show that the estimates they produce are more accurate than the estimates of the Nash equilibrium. The comparison with the quantal-regret method shows that the behavioral methods have better hit rates, but the quantal-regret method performs better in terms of the overall mean squared error, and we discuss the differences between the methods.",cs,GT,2021,How do behavioral equilibrium models compare to the quantal regret and Nash equilibrium methods in accurately estimating the preferences of human agents from data on repeated interactions in strategic systems?
53,Does QA-based intermediate training help fine-tuning language models for text classification?,"Fine-tuning pre-trained language models for downstream tasks has become a norm for NLP. Recently it is found that intermediate training based on high-level inference tasks such as Question Answering (QA) can improve the performance of some language models for target tasks. However it is not clear if intermediate training generally benefits various language models. In this paper, using the SQuAD-2.0 QA task for intermediate training for target text classification tasks, we experimented on eight tasks for single-sequence classification and eight tasks for sequence-pair classification using two base and two compact language models. Our experiments show that QA-based intermediate training generates varying transfer performance across different language models, except for similar QA tasks.",cs,CL,2021,Does QA-based intermediate training enhance the fine-tuning performance of different language models for text classification tasks?

We introduce a new formulation of this problem as a particular instance of a graph edit problem over the call graphs of the programs. In this formulation, the quality of a mapping is evaluated simultaneously with respect to both function content and call graph similarities. We show that this formulation is equivalent to a network alignment problem. We propose a solving strategy for this problem based on max-product belief propagation. Finally, we implement a prototype of our method, called QBinDiff, and propose an extensive evaluation which shows that our approach outperforms state of the art diffing tools.",cs,LG,2021,How can binary diffing be effectively formulated and solved as a network alignment problem using belief propagation to improve function matching between binary programs?
55,Rethinking with Retrieval: Faithful Large Language Model Inference,"Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, the stored knowledge in these models may inevitably be incomplete, out-of-date, or incorrect. This motivates the need to utilize external knowledge to assist LLMs. Unfortunately, current methods for incorporating external knowledge often require additional training or fine-tuning, which can be costly and may not be feasible for LLMs. To address this issue, we propose a novel post-processing approach, rethinking with retrieval (RR), which retrieves relevant external knowledge based on the decomposed reasoning steps obtained from the chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. This lightweight approach does not require additional training or fine-tuning and is not limited by the input length of LLMs. We evaluate the effectiveness of RR through extensive experiments with GPT-3 on three complex reasoning tasks: commonsense reasoning, temporal reasoning, and tabular reasoning. Our results show that RR can produce more faithful explanations and improve the performance of LLMs.",cs,CL,2022,How can the integration of external knowledge through a post-processing retrieval approach enhance the accuracy and reliability of large language models in complex reasoning tasks without requiring additional training or fine-tuning?
56,MAUVE Scores for Generative Models: Theory and Practice,"Generative artificial intelligence has made significant strides, producing text indistinguishable from human prose and remarkably photorealistic images. Automatically measuring how close the generated data distribution is to the target distribution is central to diagnosing existing models and developing better ones. We present MAUVE, a family of comparison measures between pairs of distributions such as those encountered in the generative modeling of text or images. These scores are statistical summaries of divergence frontiers capturing two types of errors in generative modeling. We explore three approaches to statistically estimate these scores: vector quantization, non-parametric estimation, and classifier-based estimation. We provide statistical bounds for the vector quantization approach.   Empirically, we find that the proposed scores paired with a range of $f$-divergences and statistical estimation methods can quantify the gaps between the distributions of human-written text and those of modern neural language models by correlating with human judgments and identifying known properties of the generated texts. We demonstrate in the vision domain that MAUVE can identify known properties of generated images on par with or better than existing metrics. In conclusion, we present practical recommendations for using MAUVE effectively with language and image modalities.",cs,LG,2022,How can MAUVE scores be effectively utilized to measure and compare the distributional similarities between generated text and images against their human counterparts in generative modeling?
57,New Challenges in Reinforcement Learning: A Survey of Security and Privacy,"Reinforcement learning (RL) is one of the most important branches of AI. Due to its capacity for self-adaption and decision-making in dynamic environments, reinforcement learning has been widely applied in multiple areas, such as healthcare, data markets, autonomous driving, and robotics. However, some of these applications and systems have been shown to be vulnerable to security or privacy attacks, resulting in unreliable or unstable services. A large number of studies have focused on these security and privacy problems in reinforcement learning. However, few surveys have provided a systematic review and comparison of existing problems and state-of-the-art solutions to keep up with the pace of emerging threats. Accordingly, we herein present such a comprehensive review to explain and summarize the challenges associated with security and privacy in reinforcement learning from a new perspective, namely that of the Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this survey, we first introduce the key concepts related to this area. Next, we cover the security and privacy issues linked to the state, action, environment, and reward function of the MDP process, respectively. We further highlight the special characteristics of security and privacy methodologies related to reinforcement learning. Finally, we discuss the possible future research directions within this area.",cs,LG,2022,"What are the key security and privacy challenges associated with reinforcement learning applications, and how can they be systematically addressed within the framework of Markov Decision Processes?"

59,Masked Modeling for Self-supervised Representation Learning on Vision and Beyond,"As the deep learning revolution marches on, self-supervised learning has garnered increasing attention in recent years thanks to its remarkable representation learning ability and the low dependence on labeled data. Among these varied self-supervised techniques, masked modeling has emerged as a distinctive approach that involves predicting parts of the original data that are proportionally masked during training. This paradigm enables deep models to learn robust representations and has demonstrated exceptional performance in the context of computer vision, natural language processing, and other modalities. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of the masked modeling framework and its methodology. We elaborate on the details of techniques within masked modeling, including diverse masking strategies, recovering targets, network architectures, and more. Then, we systematically investigate its wide-ranging applications across domains. Furthermore, we also explore the commonalities and differences between masked modeling methods in different fields.

60,Generating High-Precision Force Fields for Molecular Dynamics Simulations to Study Chemical Reaction Mechanisms using Molecular Configuration Transformer,"Theoretical studies on chemical reaction mechanisms have been crucial in organic chemistry. Traditionally, calculating the manually constructed molecular conformations of transition states for chemical reactions using quantum chemical calculations is the most commonly used method. However, this way is heavily dependent on individual experience and chemical intuition. In our previous study, we proposed a research paradigm that uses enhanced sampling in molecular dynamics simulations to study chemical reactions. This approach can directly simulate the entire process of a chemical reaction. However, the computational speed limits the use of high-precision potential energy functions for simulations. To address this issue, we present a scheme for training high-precision force fields for molecular modeling using a previously developed graph-neural-network-based molecular model, molecular configuration transformer. This potential energy function allows for highly accurate simulations at a low computational cost, leading to more precise calculations of the mechanism of chemical reactions.

However, due to the high heterogeneity in structure and semantics among various spatio-temporal modalities, the joint interpretation of multimodal spatio-temporal data has long been an extremely challenging problem. The primary challenge resides in striking a trade-off between the cohesion and autonomy of diverse modalities. This trade-off becomes progressively nonlinear as the number of modalities expands. Inspired by the human cognitive system and linguistic philosophy, where perceptual signals from the five senses converge into language, we introduce the Language as Reference Framework (LaRF), a fundamental principle for constructing a multimodal unified model. Building upon this, we propose AllSpark, a multimodal spatio-temporal general artificial intelligence model. Our model integrates ten different modalities into a unified framework. To achieve modal cohesion, AllSpark introduces a modal bridge and multimodal large language model (LLM) to map diverse modal features into the language feature space. To maintain modality autonomy, AllSpark uses modality-specific encoders to extract the tokens of various spatio-temporal modalities. Finally, observing a gap between the model's interpretability and downstream tasks, we designed modality-specific prompts and task heads, enhancing the model's generalization capability across specific tasks. Experiments indicate that the incorporation of language enables AllSpark to excel in few-shot classification tasks for RGB and point cloud modalities without additional training, surpassing baseline performance by up to 41.82\%.

62,On the Necessity of Metalearning: Learning Suitable Parameterizations for Learning Processes,"In this paper we will discuss metalearning and how we can go beyond the current classical learning paradigm. We will first address the importance of inductive biases in the learning process and what is at stake: the quantities of data necessary to learn. We will subsequently see the importance of choosing suitable parameterizations to end up with well-defined learning processes. Especially since in the context of real-world applications, we face numerous biases due, e.g., to the specificities of sensors, the heterogeneity of data sources, the multiplicity of points of view, etc. This will lead us to the idea of exploiting the structuring of the concepts to be learned in order to organize the learning process that we published previously. We conclude by discussing the perspectives around parameter-tying schemes and the emergence of universal aspects in the models thus learned.",cs,LG,2023,How can metalearning techniques be utilized to optimize parameterizations in learning processes to effectively address biases and improve data efficiency in real-world applications?
63,What's my role? Modelling responsibility for AI-based safety-critical systems,"AI-Based Safety-Critical Systems (AI-SCS) are being increasingly deployed in the real world. These can pose a risk of harm to people and the environment. Reducing that risk is an overarching priority during development and operation. As more AI-SCS become autonomous, a layer of risk management via human intervention has been removed. Following an accident it will be important to identify causal contributions and the different responsible actors behind those to learn from mistakes and prevent similar future events. Many authors have commented on the ""responsibility gap"" where it is difficult for developers and manufacturers to be held responsible for harmful behaviour of an AI-SCS. This is due to the complex development cycle for AI, uncertainty in AI performance, and dynamic operating environment. A human operator can become a ""liability sink"" absorbing blame for the consequences of AI-SCS outputs they weren't responsible for creating, and may not have understanding of.   This cross-disciplinary paper considers different senses of responsibility (role, moral, legal and causal), and how they apply in the context of AI-SCS safety. We use a core concept (Actor(A) is responsible for Occurrence(O)) to create role responsibility models, producing a practical method to capture responsibility relationships and provide clarity on the previously identified responsibility issues. Our paper demonstrates the approach with two examples: a retrospective analysis of the Tempe Arizona fatal collision involving an autonomous vehicle, and a safety focused predictive role-responsibility analysis for an AI-based diabetes co-morbidity predictor. In both examples our primary focus is on safety, aiming to reduce unfair or disproportionate blame being placed on operators or developers. We present a discussion and avenues for future research.",cs,CY,2023,"How can responsibility models be effectively developed and applied to clarify the roles of various actors in AI-based safety-critical systems to mitigate the ""responsibility gap"" and ensure accountability in the event of harm?"
64,PyMilo: A Python Library for ML I/O,"PyMilo is an open-source Python package that addresses the limitations of existing Machine Learning (ML) model storage formats by providing a transparent, reliable, and safe method for exporting and deploying trained models. Current formats, such as pickle and other binary formats, have significant problems, such as reliability, safety, and transparency issues. In contrast, PyMilo serializes ML models in a transparent non-executable format, enabling straightforward and safe model exchange, while also facilitating the deserialization and deployment of exported models in production environments. This package aims to provide a seamless, end-to-end solution for the exportation and importation of pre-trained ML models, which simplifies the model development and deployment pipeline.",cs,LG,2024,"How can PyMilo improve the reliability, safety, and transparency of exporting and deploying machine learning models compared to existing storage formats?"
65,LLM-MedQA: Enhancing Medical Question Answering through Case Studies in Large Language Models,"Accurate and efficient question-answering systems are essential for delivering high-quality patient care in the medical field. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides across various domains, they continue to face significant challenges in medical question answering, particularly in understanding domain-specific terminologies and performing complex reasoning. These limitations undermine their effectiveness in critical medical applications. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach incorporating similar case generation within a multi-agent medical question-answering (MedQA) system. Specifically, we leverage the Llama3.1:70B model, a state-of-the-art LLM, in a multi-agent architecture to enhance performance on the MedQA dataset using zero-shot learning. Our method capitalizes on the model's inherent medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities, eliminating the need for additional training data. Experimental results show substantial performance gains over existing benchmark models, with improvements of 7% in both accuracy and F1-score across various medical QA tasks. Furthermore, we examine the model's interpretability and reliability in addressing complex medical queries. This research not only offers a robust solution for medical question answering but also establishes a foundation for broader applications of LLMs in the medical domain.",cs,CL,2024,How can the integration of case generation within a multi-agent architecture improve the accuracy and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models in medical question answering?
66,H-Net: A Multitask Architecture for Simultaneous 3D Force Estimation and Stereo Semantic Segmentation in Intracardiac Catheters,"The success rate of catheterization procedures is closely linked to the sensory data provided to the surgeon. Vision-based deep learning models can deliver both tactile and visual information in a sensor-free manner, while also being cost-effective to produce. Given the complexity of these models for devices with limited computational resources, research has focused on force estimation and catheter segmentation separately. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive architecture capable of simultaneously segmenting the catheter from two different angles and estimating the applied forces in 3D. To bridge this gap, this work proposes a novel, lightweight, multi-input, multi-output encoder-decoder-based architecture. It is designed to segment the catheter from two points of view and concurrently measure the applied forces in the x, y, and z directions. This network processes two simultaneous X-Ray images, intended to be fed by a biplane fluoroscopy system, showing a catheter's deflection from different angles. It uses two parallel sub-networks with shared parameters to output two segmentation maps corresponding to the inputs. Additionally, it leverages stereo vision to estimate the applied forces at the catheter's tip in 3D. The architecture features two input channels, two classification heads for segmentation, and a regression head for force estimation through a single end-to-end architecture. The output of all heads was assessed and compared with the literature, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both segmentation and force estimation. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time such a model has been proposed",eess,IV,2024,"How can a lightweight, multitask deep learning architecture effectively integrate simultaneous 3D force estimation and stereo semantic segmentation for intracardiac catheters using biplane fluoroscopy images?"
67,TinyHelen's First Curriculum: Training and Evaluating Tiny Language Models in a Simpler Language Environment,"Training language models (LMs) and their application agents is increasingly costly due to large datasets and models, making test failures difficult to bear. Simplified language environments serve as primordial training and testing grounds, retaining essential commonsense and communication skills but in a more digestible form, potentially enhancing the learning efficiency of LMs, and thus reducing the required model size and data volume for effective training and evaluation. In these simplified language environments, workable strategies for small models, datasets, and agents may be adaptable to larger models, datasets, and agents in complex language environments.   To create such environments, we focus on two aspects: i) minimizing language dataset noise and complexity, and ii) preserving the essential text distribution characteristics. Unlike previous methods, we propose a pipeline to refine text data by eliminating noise, minimizing vocabulary, and maintaining genre-specific patterns (e.g., for books, conversation, code, etc.). Implementing this pipeline with large LMs, we have created a leaner suite of LM training and evaluation datasets: 71M Leaner-Pretrain, 7M Leaner-Instruct, Leaner-Glue for assessing linguistic proficiency, and Leaner-Eval for testing instruction-following ability.   Our experiments show that leaner pre-training boosts LM learning efficiency. Tiny LMs trained on these datasets outperform those trained on original datasets in instruction-following across different language granularity levels. Moreover, the Leaner-Pretrain dataset's alignment with conventional large LM training sets enables resource-optimized analysis of how learning objectives, model architectures, and training techniques impact performance on language modeling and downstream tasks. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/EmpathYang/TinyHelen.git.",cs,CL,2024,"How can simplified language environments and refined datasets enhance the training efficiency and performance of tiny language models compared to traditional, larger datasets?"
68,Budget-aware Test-time Scaling via Discriminative Verification,"Test-time scaling is a powerful strategy for boosting the performance of large language models on complex reasoning tasks. While state-of-the-art approaches often employ generative verifiers to select the best solution from a pool of candidates, this method incurs prohibitive computational costs, limiting its practicality. In this work, we shift the focus to a more budget-aware paradigm: discriminative verification. We conduct a thorough empirical analysis and demonstrate that while discriminative verifiers may underperform in isolation, combining them with self-consistency in a hybrid approach creates a powerful and efficient test-time scaling mechanism. Notably, under a fixed compute budget, this hybrid approach surpasses state-of-the-art generative verification by a significant margin: achieving up to 15.3\% higher accuracy on AIME2025. Our findings establish that for practical, real-world applications, budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers is not only a ""free"" upgrade over self-consistency, but also a more effective and efficient alternative to costly generative techniques. Code is available at https://github.com/wang-research-lab/verification.",cs,AI,2025,How can budget-aware discriminative verification improve the efficiency and accuracy of test-time scaling in large language models compared to traditional generative verification methods?
69,"Scaling Artificial Intelligence for Multi-Tumor Early Detection with More Reports, Fewer Masks","Early tumor detection save lives. Each year, more than 300 million computed tomography (CT) scans are performed worldwide, offering a vast opportunity for effective cancer screening. However, detecting small or early-stage tumors on these CT scans remains challenging, even for experts. Artificial intelligence (AI) models can assist by highlighting suspicious regions, but training such models typically requires extensive tumor masks--detailed, voxel-wise outlines of tumors manually drawn by radiologists. Drawing these masks is costly, requiring years of effort and millions of dollars. In contrast, nearly every CT scan in clinical practice is already accompanied by medical reports describing the tumor's size, number, appearance, and sometimes, pathology results--information that is rich, abundant, and often underutilized for AI training. We introduce R-Super, which trains AI to segment tumors that match their descriptions in medical reports. This approach scales AI training with large collections of readily available medical reports, substantially reducing the need for manually drawn tumor masks. When trained on 101,654 reports, AI models achieved performance comparable to those trained on 723 masks. Combining reports and masks further improved sensitivity by +13% and specificity by +8%, surpassing radiologists in detecting five of the seven tumor types. Notably, R-Super enabled segmentation of tumors in the spleen, gallbladder, prostate, bladder, uterus, and esophagus, for which no public masks or AI models previously existed. This study challenges the long-held belief that large-scale, labor-intensive tumor mask creation is indispensable, establishing a scalable and accessible path toward early detection across diverse tumor types.   We plan to release our trained models, code, and dataset at https://github.com/MrGiovanni/R-Super",cs,CV,2025,How can artificial intelligence be effectively trained for early tumor detection using medical reports instead of extensive manually drawn tumor masks?
70,LaSeR: Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token Self-Rewarding,"Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a core paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). To address the lack of verification signals at test time, prior studies incorporate the training of model's self-verification capability into the standard RLVR process, thereby unifying reasoning and verification capabilities within a single LLM. However, previous practice requires the LLM to sequentially generate solutions and self-verifications using two separate prompt templates, which significantly reduces efficiency. In this work, we theoretically reveal that the closed-form solution to the RL objective of self-verification can be reduced to a remarkably simple form: the true reasoning reward of a solution is equal to its last-token self-rewarding score, which is computed as the difference between the policy model's next-token log-probability assigned to any pre-specified token at the solution's last token and a pre-calculated constant, scaled by the KL coefficient. Based on this insight, we propose LaSeR (Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token Self-Rewarding), an algorithm that simply augments the original RLVR loss with a MSE loss that aligns the last-token self-rewarding scores with verifier-based reasoning rewards, jointly optimizing the reasoning and self-rewarding capabilities of LLMs. The optimized self-rewarding scores can be utilized in both training and testing to enhance model performance. Notably, our algorithm derives these scores from the predicted next-token probability distribution of the last token immediately after generation, incurring only the minimal extra cost of one additional token inference. Experiments show that our method not only improves the model's reasoning performance but also equips it with remarkable self-rewarding capability, thereby boosting its inference-time scaling performance.",cs,CL,2025,How can the integration of last-token self-rewarding scores into the reinforcement learning process enhance the reasoning and self-verification capabilities of Large Language Models while improving efficiency during both training and testing?
71,Agentic Design of Compositional Machines,"The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence and a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional demands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To support this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the machine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical simulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities required for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and instruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start dataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.",cs,AI,2025,"How can large language models be effectively trained to design and assemble compositional machines in simulated environments, and what key capabilities are necessary for their success in this task?"
72,Seesaw: Accelerating Training by Balancing Learning Rate and Batch Size Scheduling,"Increasing the batch size during training -- a ''batch ramp'' -- is a promising strategy to accelerate large language model pretraining. While for SGD, doubling the batch size can be equivalent to halving the learning rate, the optimal strategy for adaptive optimizers like Adam is less clear. As a result, any batch-ramp scheduling, if used at all, is typically tuned heuristically. This work develops a principled framework for batch-size scheduling and introduces Seesaw: whenever a standard scheduler would halve the learning rate, Seesaw instead multiplies it by $1/\sqrt{2}$ and doubles the batch size, preserving loss dynamics while reducing serial steps. Theoretically, we provide, to our knowledge, the first finite-sample proof of equivalence between learning-rate decay and batch-size ramp-up for SGD on noisy linear regression, and we extend this equivalence to normalized SGD, a tractable proxy for Adam, under a variance-dominated regime observed in practice. Empirically, on 150M/300M/600M-parameter models trained at Chinchilla scale using a constant (critical) batch size, Seesaw matches cosine decay at equal FLOPs while reducing wall-clock time by $\approx 36\%$, approaching the theoretical limit implied by our analysis.",cs,LG,2025,"How can a principled framework for scheduling learning rates and batch sizes, such as the Seesaw method, optimize training efficiency for large language models using adaptive optimizers like Adam?"
