1,Towards Integrated Glance To Restructuring in Combinatorial Optimization,"The paper focuses on a new class of combinatorial problems which consists in restructuring of solutions (as sets/structures) in combinatorial optimization. Two main features of the restructuring process are examined: (i) a cost of the restructuring, (ii) a closeness to a goal solution. Three types of the restructuring problems are under study: (a) one-stage structuring, (b) multi-stage structuring, and (c) structuring over changed element set. One-criterion and multicriteria problem formulations can be considered. The restructuring problems correspond to redesign (improvement, upgrade) of modular systems or solutions. The restructuring approach is described and illustrated (problem statements, solving schemes, examples) for the following combinatorial optimization problems: knapsack problem, multiple choice problem, assignment problem, spanning tree problems, clustering problem, multicriteria ranking (sorting) problem, morphological clique problem. Numerical examples illustrate the restructuring problems and solving schemes.",cs,AI,2015,How can the restructuring of solutions in combinatorial optimization be effectively formulated and solved to minimize restructuring costs while achieving proximity to desired goal solutions across various problem types?
2,"Simple, Robust and Optimal Ranking from Pairwise Comparisons","We consider data in the form of pairwise comparisons of n items, with the goal of precisely identifying the top k items for some value of k < n, or alternatively, recovering a ranking of all the items. We analyze the Copeland counting algorithm that ranks the items in order of the number of pairwise comparisons won, and show it has three attractive features: (a) its computational efficiency leads to speed-ups of several orders of magnitude in computation time as compared to prior work; (b) it is robust in that theoretical guarantees impose no conditions on the underlying matrix of pairwise-comparison probabilities, in contrast to some prior work that applies only to the BTL parametric model; and (c) it is an optimal method up to constant factors, meaning that it achieves the information-theoretic limits for recovering the top k-subset. We extend our results to obtain sharp guarantees for approximate recovery under the Hamming distortion metric, and more generally, to any arbitrary error requirement that satisfies a simple and natural monotonicity condition.",cs,LG,2015,"How can the Copeland counting algorithm be effectively utilized to achieve optimal ranking of items based on pairwise comparisons, while ensuring computational efficiency and robustness against varying underlying probability distributions?"
3,Cutting-off Redundant Repeating Generations for Neural Abstractive Summarization,This paper tackles the reduction of redundant repeating generation that is often observed in RNN-based encoder-decoder models. Our basic idea is to jointly estimate the upper-bound frequency of each target vocabulary in the encoder and control the output words based on the estimation in the decoder. Our method shows significant improvement over a strong RNN-based encoder-decoder baseline and achieved its best results on an abstractive summarization benchmark.,cs,CL,2016,How can the estimation of target vocabulary frequency in RNN-based encoder-decoder models reduce redundancy in neural abstractive summarization outputs?
4,A Latent-class Model for Estimating Product-choice Probabilities from Clickstream Data,"This paper analyzes customer product-choice behavior based on the recency and frequency of each customer's page views on e-commerce sites. Recently, we devised an optimization model for estimating product-choice probabilities that satisfy monotonicity, convexity, and concavity constraints with respect to recency and frequency. This shape-restricted model delivered high predictive performance even when there were few training samples. However, typical e-commerce sites deal in many different varieties of products, so the predictive performance of the model can be further improved by integration of such product heterogeneity. For this purpose, we develop a novel latent-class shape-restricted model for estimating product-choice probabilities for each latent class of products. We also give a tailored expectation-maximization algorithm for parameter estimation. Computational results demonstrate that higher predictive performance is achieved with our latent-class model than with the previous shape-restricted model and common latent-class logistic regression.",cs,AI,2016,How can a latent-class shape-restricted model improve the estimation of product-choice probabilities in e-commerce by accounting for product heterogeneity in customer clickstream data?
5,Report: Dynamic Eye Movement Matching and Visualization Tool in Neuro Gesture,"In the research of the impact of gestures using by a lecturer, one challenging task is to infer the attention of a group of audiences. Two important measurements that can help infer the level of attention are eye movement data and Electroencephalography (EEG) data. Under the fundamental assumption that a group of people would look at the same place if they all pay attention at the same time, we apply a method, ""Time Warp Edit Distance"", to calculate the similarity of their eye movement trajectories. Moreover, we also cluster eye movement pattern of audiences based on these pair-wised similarity metrics. Besides, since we don't have a direct metric for the ""attention"" ground truth, a visual assessment would be beneficial to evaluate the gesture-attention relationship. Thus we also implement a visualization tool.",cs,NE,2017,"How can the similarity of eye movement trajectories and EEG data be utilized to assess audience attention during a lecture, and what role does a visualization tool play in evaluating the relationship between gestures and attention?"
6,Automated Conjecturing VII: The Graph Brain Project & Big Mathematics,"The Graph Brain Project is an experiment in how the use of automated mathematical discovery software, databases, large collaboration, and systematic investigation provide a model for how mathematical research might proceed in the future.   Our Project began with the development of a program that can be used to generate invariant-relation and property-relation conjectures in many areas of mathematics. This program can produce conjectures which are not implied by existing (published) theorems. Here we propose a new approach to push forward existing mathematical research goals---using automated mathematical discovery software. We suggest how to initiate and harness large-scale collaborative mathematics. We envision mathematical research labs similar to what exist in other sciences, new avenues for funding, new opportunities for training students, and a more efficient and effective use of published mathematical research.   And our experiment in graph theory can be imitated in many other areas of mathematical research. Big Mathematics is the idea of large, systematic, collaborative research on problems of existing mathematical interest. What is possible when we put our skills, tools, and results together systematically?",cs,AI,2017,
7,Attention-Based Capsule Networks with Dynamic Routing for Relation Extraction,"A capsule is a group of neurons, whose activity vector represents the instantiation parameters of a specific type of entity. In this paper, we explore the capsule networks used for relation extraction in a multi-instance multi-label learning framework and propose a novel neural approach based on capsule networks with attention mechanisms. We evaluate our method with different benchmarks, and it is demonstrated that our method improves the precision of the predicted relations. Particularly, we show that capsule networks improve multiple entity pairs relation extraction.",cs,IR,2018,
8,ADMM-NN: An Algorithm-Hardware Co-Design Framework of DNNs Using Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers,"To facilitate efficient embedded and hardware implementations of deep neural networks (DNNs), two important categories of DNN model compression techniques: weight pruning and weight quantization are investigated. The former leverages the redundancy in the number of weights, whereas the latter leverages the redundancy in bit representation of weights. However, there lacks a systematic framework of joint weight pruning and quantization of DNNs, thereby limiting the available model compression ratio. Moreover, the computation reduction, energy efficiency improvement, and hardware performance overhead need to be accounted for besides simply model size reduction.   To address these limitations, we present ADMM-NN, the first algorithm-hardware co-optimization framework of DNNs using Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), a powerful technique to deal with non-convex optimization problems with possibly combinatorial constraints. The first part of ADMM-NN is a systematic, joint framework of DNN weight pruning and quantization using ADMM. It can be understood as a smart regularization technique with regularization target dynamically updated in each ADMM iteration, thereby resulting in higher performance in model compression than prior work. The second part is hardware-aware DNN optimizations to facilitate hardware-level implementations.   Without accuracy loss, we can achieve 85$\times$ and 24$\times$ pruning on LeNet-5 and AlexNet models, respectively, significantly higher than prior work. The improvement becomes more significant when focusing on computation reductions. Combining weight pruning and quantization, we achieve 1,910$\times$ and 231$\times$ reductions in overall model size on these two benchmarks, when focusing on data storage. Highly promising results are also observed on other representative DNNs such as VGGNet and ResNet-50.",cs,LG,2018,
9,Feature-Attention Graph Convolutional Networks for Noise Resilient Learning,"Noise and inconsistency commonly exist in real-world information networks, due to inherent error-prone nature of human or user privacy concerns. To date, tremendous efforts have been made to advance feature learning from networks, including the most recent Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) or attention GCN, by integrating node content and topology structures. However, all existing methods consider networks as error-free sources and treat feature content in each node as independent and equally important to model node relations. The erroneous node content, combined with sparse features, provide essential challenges for existing methods to be used on real-world noisy networks. In this paper, we propose FA-GCN, a feature-attention graph convolution learning framework, to handle networks with noisy and sparse node content. To tackle noise and sparse content in each node, FA-GCN first employs a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to learn dense representation for each feature. To model interactions between neighboring nodes, a feature-attention mechanism is introduced to allow neighboring nodes learn and vary feature importance, with respect to their connections. By using spectral-based graph convolution aggregation process, each node is allowed to concentrate more on the most determining neighborhood features aligned with the corresponding learning task. Experiments and validations, w.r.t. different noise levels, demonstrate that FA-GCN achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods on both noise-free and noisy networks.",cs,LG,2019,
10,Uncertainty-Based Out-of-Distribution Classification in Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) data is an important goal in building reliable machine learning systems. Especially in autonomous systems, wrong predictions for OOD inputs can cause safety critical situations. As a first step towards a solution, we consider the problem of detecting such data in a value-based deep reinforcement learning (RL) setting. Modelling this problem as a one-class classification problem, we propose a framework for uncertainty-based OOD classification: UBOOD. It is based on the effect that an agent's epistemic uncertainty is reduced for situations encountered during training (in-distribution), and thus lower than for unencountered (OOD) situations. Being agnostic towards the approach used for estimating epistemic uncertainty, combinations with different uncertainty estimation methods, e.g. approximate Bayesian inference methods or ensembling techniques are possible. We further present a first viable solution for calculating a dynamic classification threshold, based on the uncertainty distribution of the training data. Evaluation shows that the framework produces reliable classification results when combined with ensemble-based estimators, while the combination with concrete dropout-based estimators fails to reliably detect OOD situations. In summary, UBOOD presents a viable approach for OOD classification in deep RL settings by leveraging the epistemic uncertainty of the agent's value function.",cs,LG,2019,
11,Out of Order: How Important Is The Sequential Order of Words in a Sentence in Natural Language Understanding Tasks?,"Do state-of-the-art natural language understanding models care about word order - one of the most important characteristics of a sequence? Not always! We found 75% to 90% of the correct predictions of BERT-based classifiers, trained on many GLUE tasks, remain constant after input words are randomly shuffled. Despite BERT embeddings are famously contextual, the contribution of each individual word to downstream tasks is almost unchanged even after the word's context is shuffled. BERT-based models are able to exploit superficial cues (e.g. the sentiment of keywords in sentiment analysis; or the word-wise similarity between sequence-pair inputs in natural language inference) to make correct decisions when tokens are arranged in random orders. Encouraging classifiers to capture word order information improves the performance on most GLUE tasks, SQuAD 2.0 and out-of-samples. Our work suggests that many GLUE tasks are not challenging machines to understand the meaning of a sentence.",cs,CL,2020,
12,Fairness-Oriented User Scheduling for Bursty Downlink Transmission Using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,"In this work, we develop practical user scheduling algorithms for downlink bursty traffic with emphasis on user fairness. In contrast to the conventional scheduling algorithms that either equally divides the transmission time slots among users or maximizing some ratios without physcial meanings, we propose to use the 5%-tile user data rate (5TUDR) as the metric to evaluate user fairness. Since it is difficult to directly optimize 5TUDR, we first cast the problem into the stochastic game framework and subsequently propose a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)-based algorithm to perform distributed optimization on the resource block group (RBG) allocation. Furthermore, each MARL agent is designed to take information measured by network counters from multiple network layers (e.g. Channel Quality Indicator, Buffer size) as the input states while the RBG allocation as action with a proposed reward function designed to maximize 5TUDR. Extensive simulation is performed to show that the proposed MARL-based scheduler can achieve fair scheduling while maintaining good average network throughput as compared to conventional schedulers.",cs,OS,2020,
13,An Efficient Federated Distillation Learning System for Multi-task Time Series Classification,"This paper proposes an efficient federated distillation learning system (EFDLS) for multi-task time series classification (TSC). EFDLS consists of a central server and multiple mobile users, where different users may run different TSC tasks. EFDLS has two novel components, namely a feature-based student-teacher (FBST) framework and a distance-based weights matching (DBWM) scheme. Within each user, the FBST framework transfers knowledge from its teacher's hidden layers to its student's hidden layers via knowledge distillation, with the teacher and student having identical network structure. For each connected user, its student model's hidden layers' weights are uploaded to the EFDLS server periodically. The DBWM scheme is deployed on the server, with the least square distance used to measure the similarity between the weights of two given models. This scheme finds a partner for each connected user such that the user's and its partner's weights are the closest among all the weights uploaded. The server exchanges and sends back the user's and its partner's weights to these two users which then load the received weights to their teachers' hidden layers. Experimental results show that the proposed EFDLS achieves excellent performance on a set of selected UCR2018 datasets regarding top-1 accuracy.",cs,LG,2021,
14,Importance of Empirical Sample Complexity Analysis for Offline Reinforcement Learning,"We hypothesize that empirically studying the sample complexity of offline reinforcement learning (RL) is crucial for the practical applications of RL in the real world. Several recent works have demonstrated the ability to learn policies directly from offline data. In this work, we ask the question of the dependency on the number of samples for learning from offline data. Our objective is to emphasize that studying sample complexity for offline RL is important, and is an indicator of the usefulness of existing offline algorithms. We propose an evaluation approach for sample complexity analysis of offline RL.",cs,LG,2021,
15,"UBIWEAR: An end-to-end, data-driven framework for intelligent physical activity prediction to empower mHealth interventions","It is indisputable that physical activity is vital for an individual's health and wellness. However, a global prevalence of physical inactivity has induced significant personal and socioeconomic implications. In recent years, a significant amount of work has showcased the capabilities of self-tracking technology to create positive health behavior change. This work is motivated by the potential of personalized and adaptive goal-setting techniques in encouraging physical activity via self-tracking. To this end, we propose UBIWEAR, an end-to-end framework for intelligent physical activity prediction, with the ultimate goal to empower data-driven goal-setting interventions. To achieve this, we experiment with numerous machine learning and deep learning paradigms as a robust benchmark for physical activity prediction tasks. To train our models, we utilize, ""MyHeart Counts"", an open, large-scale dataset collected in-the-wild from thousands of users. We also propose a prescriptive framework for self-tracking aggregated data preprocessing, to facilitate data wrangling of real-world, noisy data. Our best model achieves a MAE of 1087 steps, 65% lower than the state of the art in terms of absolute error, proving the feasibility of the physical activity prediction task, and paving the way for future research.",cs,AI,2022,
16,Image Embedding for Denoising Generative Models,"Denoising Diffusion models are gaining increasing popularity in the field of generative modeling for several reasons, including the simple and stable training, the excellent generative quality, and the solid probabilistic foundation. In this article, we address the problem of {\em embedding} an image into the latent space of Denoising Diffusion Models, that is finding a suitable ``noisy'' image whose denoising results in the original image. We particularly focus on Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models due to the deterministic nature of their reverse diffusion process. As a side result of our investigation, we gain a deeper insight into the structure of the latent space of diffusion models, opening interesting perspectives on its exploration, the definition of semantic trajectories, and the manipulation/conditioning of encodings for editing purposes. A particularly interesting property highlighted by our research, which is also characteristic of this class of generative models, is the independence of the latent representation from the networks implementing the reverse diffusion process. In other words, a common seed passed to different networks (each trained on the same dataset), eventually results in identical images.",cs,CV,2022,
17,Reviving the Context: Camera Trap Species Classification as Link Prediction on Multimodal Knowledge Graphs,"Camera traps are important tools in animal ecology for biodiversity monitoring and conservation. However, their practical application is limited by issues such as poor generalization to new and unseen locations. Images are typically associated with diverse forms of context, which may exist in different modalities. In this work, we exploit the structured context linked to camera trap images to boost out-of-distribution generalization for species classification tasks in camera traps. For instance, a picture of a wild animal could be linked to details about the time and place it was captured, as well as structured biological knowledge about the animal species. While often overlooked by existing studies, incorporating such context offers several potential benefits for better image understanding, such as addressing data scarcity and enhancing generalization. However, effectively incorporating such heterogeneous context into the visual domain is a challenging problem. To address this, we propose a novel framework that transforms species classification as link prediction in a multimodal knowledge graph (KG). This framework enables the seamless integration of diverse multimodal contexts for visual recognition. We apply this framework for out-of-distribution species classification on the iWildCam2020-WILDS and Snapshot Mountain Zebra datasets and achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, our framework enhances sample efficiency for recognizing under-represented species.",cs,CV,2023,
18,"A Survey of Personality, Persona, and Profile in Conversational Agents and Chatbots","We present a review of personality in neural conversational agents (CAs), also called chatbots. First, we define Personality, Persona, and Profile. We explain all personality schemes which have been used in CAs, and list models under the scheme(s) which they use. Second we describe 21 datasets which have been developed in recent CA personality research. Third, we define the methods used to embody personality in a CA, and review recent models using them. Fourth, we survey some relevant reviews on CAs, personality, and related topics. Finally, we draw conclusions and identify some research challenges for this important emerging field.",cs,CL,2023,
19,Fuzzy Model Identification and Self Learning with Smooth Compositions,"This paper develops a smooth model identification and self-learning strategy for dynamic systems taking into account possible parameter variations and uncertainties. We have tried to solve the problem such that the model follows the changes and variations in the system on a continuous and smooth surface. Running the model to adaptively gain the optimum values of the parameters on a smooth surface would facilitate further improvements in the application of other derivative based optimization control algorithms such as MPC or robust control algorithms to achieve a combined modeling-control scheme. Compared to the earlier works on the smooth fuzzy modeling structures, we could reach a desired trade-off between the model optimality and the computational load. The proposed method has been evaluated on a test problem as well as the non-linear dynamic of a chemical process.",eess,SY,2024,
20,Re-evaluating Automatic LLM System Ranking for Alignment with Human Preference,"Evaluating and ranking the capabilities of different LLMs is crucial for understanding their performance and alignment with human preferences. Due to the high cost and time-consuming nature of human evaluations, an automatic LLM bencher (i.e., an automatic evaluation framework that aims to rank LLMs based on their alignment with human preferences) is indispensable. An automatic LLM bencher consists of four components: the input set (e.g., a user instruction), the evaluation model (e.g., an LLM), the evaluation type (e.g., pairwise comparison), and the aggregation method (e.g., the ELO rating system). However, previous work has not thoroughly explored how to select these components or how their different combinations influence the results. In this work, through controlled experiments, we provide a series of recommendations on how to choose each component to better automate the evaluation of LLMs. Furthermore, we discovered that when evaluating LLMs with similar performance, the performance of the automatic LLM bencher declines sharply, underscoring the limitations of current benchers and calling for future work. Lastly, we found that the evaluation models' performance at the instance level (e.g., the accuracy of selecting the best output) does not always align with their effectiveness when used as a component of a bencher, highlighting the importance of dedicated system-level evaluation of benchers.",cs,CL,2024,
21,Simplicial Embeddings Improve Sample Efficiency in Actor-Critic Agents,"Recent works have proposed accelerating the wall-clock training time of actor-critic methods via the use of large-scale environment parallelization; unfortunately, these can sometimes still require large number of environment interactions to achieve a desired level of performance. Noting that well-structured representations can improve the generalization and sample efficiency of deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents, we propose the use of simplicial embeddings: lightweight representation layers that constrain embeddings to simplicial structures. This geometric inductive bias results in sparse and discrete features that stabilize critic bootstrapping and strengthen policy gradients. When applied to FastTD3, FastSAC, and PPO, simplicial embeddings consistently improve sample efficiency and final performance across a variety of continuous- and discrete-control environments, without any loss in runtime speed.",cs,LG,2025,
22,A Methodology for Assessing the Risk of Metric Failure in LLMs Within the Financial Domain,"As Generative Artificial Intelligence is adopted across the financial services industry, a significant barrier to adoption and usage is measuring model performance. Historical machine learning metrics can oftentimes fail to generalize to GenAI workloads and are often supplemented using Subject Matter Expert (SME) Evaluation. Even in this combination, many projects fail to account for various unique risks present in choosing specific metrics. Additionally, many widespread benchmarks created by foundational research labs and educational institutions fail to generalize to industrial use. This paper explains these challenges and provides a Risk Assessment Framework to allow for better application of SME and machine learning Metrics",cs,AI,2025,
