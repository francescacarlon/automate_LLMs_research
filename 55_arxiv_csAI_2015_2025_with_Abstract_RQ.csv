1,Learning Discrete Bayesian Networks from Continuous Data,"Learning Bayesian networks from raw data can help provide insights into the relationships between variables. While real data often contains a mixture of discrete and continuous-valued variables, many Bayesian network structure learning algorithms assume all random variables are discrete. Thus, continuous variables are often discretized when learning a Bayesian network. However, the choice of discretization policy has significant impact on the accuracy, speed, and interpretability of the resulting models. This paper introduces a principled Bayesian discretization method for continuous variables in Bayesian networks with quadratic complexity instead of the cubic complexity of other standard techniques. Empirical demonstrations show that the proposed method is superior to the established minimum description length algorithm. In addition, this paper shows how to incorporate existing methods into the structure learning process to discretize all continuous variables and simultaneously learn Bayesian network structures.",cs,AI,2015,"How can a principled Bayesian discretization method improve the accuracy, speed, and interpretability of Bayesian network structure learning from continuous data compared to traditional discretization techniques?"
2,GELATO and SAGE: An Integrated Framework for MS Annotation,"Several algorithms and tools have been developed to (semi) automate the process of glycan identification by interpreting Mass Spectrometric data. However, each has limitations when annotating MSn data with thousands of MS spectra using uncurated public databases. Moreover, the existing tools are not designed to manage MSn data where n > 2. We propose a novel software package to automate the annotation of tandem MS data. This software consists of two major components. The first, is a free, semi-automated MSn data interpreter called the Glycomic Elucidation and Annotation Tool (GELATO). This tool extends and automates the functionality of existing open source projects, namely, GlycoWorkbench (GWB) and GlycomeDB. The second is a machine learning model called Smart Anotation Enhancement Graph (SAGE), which learns the behavior of glycoanalysts to select annotations generated by GELATO that emulate human interpretation of the spectra.",cs,AI,2015,How can the integration of GELATO and SAGE improve the accuracy and efficiency of glycan identification in tandem mass spectrometry (MSn) data analysis compared to existing tools?
3,Bayes-Optimal Effort Allocation in Crowdsourcing: Bounds and Index Policies,"We consider effort allocation in crowdsourcing, where we wish to assign labeling tasks to imperfect homogeneous crowd workers to maximize overall accuracy in a continuous-time Bayesian setting, subject to budget and time constraints. The Bayes-optimal policy for this problem is the solution to a partially observable Markov decision process, but the curse of dimensionality renders the computation infeasible. Based on the Lagrangian Relaxation technique in Adelman & Mersereau (2008), we provide a computationally tractable instance-specific upper bound on the value of this Bayes-optimal policy, which can in turn be used to bound the optimality gap of any other sub-optimal policy. In an approach similar in spirit to the Whittle index for restless multiarmed bandits, we provide an index policy for effort allocation in crowdsourcing and demonstrate numerically that it outperforms other stateof- arts and performs close to optimal solution.",cs,LG,2015,"How can effort allocation in crowdsourcing be optimized under budget and time constraints using computationally tractable methods, while addressing the challenges posed by the curse of dimensionality in determining the Bayes-optimal policy?"
4,Extracting Biomolecular Interactions Using Semantic Parsing of Biomedical Text,"We advance the state of the art in biomolecular interaction extraction with three contributions: (i) We show that deep, Abstract Meaning Representations (AMR) significantly improve the accuracy of a biomolecular interaction extraction system when compared to a baseline that relies solely on surface- and syntax-based features; (ii) In contrast with previous approaches that infer relations on a sentence-by-sentence basis, we expand our framework to enable consistent predictions over sets of sentences (documents); (iii) We further modify and expand a graph kernel learning framework to enable concurrent exploitation of automatically induced AMR (semantic) and dependency structure (syntactic) representations. Our experiments show that our approach yields interaction extraction systems that are more robust in environments where there is a significant mismatch between training and test conditions.",cs,CL,2015,How can the integration of Abstract Meaning Representations and graph kernel learning improve the accuracy and robustness of biomolecular interaction extraction from biomedical texts?
5,Addressing Complex and Subjective Product-Related Queries with Customer Reviews,"Online reviews are often our first port of call when considering products and purchases online. When evaluating a potential purchase, we may have a specific query in mind, e.g. `will this baby seat fit in the overhead compartment of a 747?' or `will I like this album if I liked Taylor Swift's 1989?'. To answer such questions we must either wade through huge volumes of consumer reviews hoping to find one that is relevant, or otherwise pose our question directly to the community via a Q/A system.   In this paper we hope to fuse these two paradigms: given a large volume of previously answered queries about products, we hope to automatically learn whether a review of a product is relevant to a given query. We formulate this as a machine learning problem using a mixture-of-experts-type framework---here each review is an `expert' that gets to vote on the response to a particular query; simultaneously we learn a relevance function such that `relevant' reviews are those that vote correctly. At test time this learned relevance function allows us to surface reviews that are relevant to new queries on-demand. We evaluate our system, Moqa, on a novel corpus of 1.4 million questions (and answers) and 13 million reviews. We show quantitatively that it is effective at addressing both binary and open-ended queries, and qualitatively that it surfaces reviews that human evaluators consider to be relevant.",cs,IR,2015,How can machine learning be utilized to automatically identify and surface relevant customer reviews in response to complex and subjective product-related queries?
6,Highway and Residual Networks learn Unrolled Iterative Estimation,"The past year saw the introduction of new architectures such as Highway networks and Residual networks which, for the first time, enabled the training of feedforward networks with dozens to hundreds of layers using simple gradient descent. While depth of representation has been posited as a primary reason for their success, there are indications that these architectures defy a popular view of deep learning as a hierarchical computation of increasingly abstract features at each layer.   In this report, we argue that this view is incomplete and does not adequately explain several recent findings. We propose an alternative viewpoint based on unrolled iterative estimation -- a group of successive layers iteratively refine their estimates of the same features instead of computing an entirely new representation. We demonstrate that this viewpoint directly leads to the construction of Highway and Residual networks. Finally we provide preliminary experiments to discuss the similarities and differences between the two architectures.",cs,NE,2016,"How do Highway and Residual networks utilize unrolled iterative estimation to refine feature representations, and how does this approach differ from traditional hierarchical deep learning models?"
7,EnhanceNet: Single Image Super-Resolution Through Automated Texture Synthesis,"Single image super-resolution is the task of inferring a high-resolution image from a single low-resolution input. Traditionally, the performance of algorithms for this task is measured using pixel-wise reconstruction measures such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) which have been shown to correlate poorly with the human perception of image quality. As a result, algorithms minimizing these metrics tend to produce over-smoothed images that lack high-frequency textures and do not look natural despite yielding high PSNR values.   We propose a novel application of automated texture synthesis in combination with a perceptual loss focusing on creating realistic textures rather than optimizing for a pixel-accurate reproduction of ground truth images during training. By using feed-forward fully convolutional neural networks in an adversarial training setting, we achieve a significant boost in image quality at high magnification ratios. Extensive experiments on a number of datasets show the effectiveness of our approach, yielding state-of-the-art results in both quantitative and qualitative benchmarks.",cs,CV,2016,How can automated texture synthesis and perceptual loss be integrated into single image super-resolution algorithms to improve the realism and quality of generated high-resolution images?
8,Efficient iterative policy optimization,"We tackle the issue of finding a good policy when the number of policy updates is limited. This is done by approximating the expected policy reward as a sequence of concave lower bounds which can be efficiently maximized, drastically reducing the number of policy updates required to achieve good performance. We also extend existing methods to negative rewards, enabling the use of control variates.",cs,AI,2016,How can we efficiently optimize policy performance with limited updates by utilizing concave lower bounds and control variates in the presence of negative rewards?
9,An argumentative agent-based model of scientific inquiry,"In this paper we present an agent-based model (ABM) of scientific inquiry aimed at investigating how different social networks impact the efficiency of scientists in acquiring knowledge. As such, the ABM is a computational tool for tackling issues in the domain of scientific methodology and science policy. In contrast to existing ABMs of science, our model aims to represent the argumentative dynamics that underlies scientific practice. To this end we employ abstract argumentation theory as the core design feature of the model. This helps to avoid a number of problematic idealizations which are present in other ABMs of science and which impede their relevance for actual scientific practice.",cs,SI,2016,"How do different social network structures influence the efficiency of knowledge acquisition in scientific inquiry, as modeled through argumentative dynamics?"
10,A hybrid approach to supervised machine learning for algorithmic melody composition,"In this work we present an algorithm for composing monophonic melodies similar in style to those of a given, phrase annotated, sample of melodies. For implementation, a hybrid approach incorporating parametric Markov models of higher order and a contour concept of phrases is used. This work is based on the master thesis of Thayabaran Kathiresan (2015). An online listening test conducted shows that enhancing a pure Markov model with musically relevant context, like count and planed melody contour, improves the result significantly.",cs,AI,2016,How can the integration of parametric Markov models and musical contour concepts enhance the composition of monophonic melodies that resemble a given style?
11,Nonparametric Inference for Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes,"We would like to learn latent representations that are low-dimensional and highly interpretable. A model that has these characteristics is the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model. The benefits and negative of the GP-LVM are complementary to the Variational Autoencoder, the former provides interpretable low-dimensional latent representations while the latter is able to handle large amounts of data and can use non-Gaussian likelihoods. Our inspiration for this paper is to marry these two approaches and reap the benefits of both. In order to do so we will introduce a novel approximate inference scheme inspired by the GP-LVM and the VAE. We show experimentally that the approximation allows the capacity of the generative bottle-neck (Z) of the VAE to be arbitrarily large without losing a highly interpretable representation, allowing reconstruction quality to be unlimited by Z at the same time as a low-dimensional space can be used to perform ancestral sampling from as well as a means to reason about the embedded data.",stat,ML,2017,How can a novel approximate inference scheme be developed to combine the strengths of Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models and Variational Autoencoders for improved interpretability and reconstruction quality in low-dimensional latent representations?
12,Learning Representations from Road Network for End-to-End Urban Growth Simulation,"From our experiences in the past, we have seen that the growth of cities is very much dependent on the transportation networks. In mega cities, transportation networks determine to a significant extent as to where the people will move and houses will be built. Hence, transportation network data is crucial to an urban growth prediction system. Existing works have used manually derived distance based features based on the road networks to build models on urban growth. But due to the non-generic and laborious nature of the manual feature engineering process, we can shift to End-to-End systems which do not rely on manual feature engineering. In this paper, we propose a method to integrate road network data to an existing Rule based End-to-End framework without manual feature engineering. Our method employs recurrent neural networks to represent road networks in a structured way such that it can be plugged into the previously proposed End-to-End framework. The proposed approach enhances the performance in terms of Figure of Merit, Producer's accuracy, User's accuracy and Overall accuracy of the existing Rule based End-to-End framework.",cs,AI,2017,"How can recurrent neural networks be utilized to automatically integrate road network data into an End-to-End urban growth simulation framework, thereby improving prediction accuracy without manual feature engineering?"
13,Reinforcement Learning with Analogical Similarity to Guide Schema Induction and Attention,"Research in analogical reasoning suggests that higher-order cognitive functions such as abstract reasoning, far transfer, and creativity are founded on recognizing structural similarities among relational systems. Here we integrate theories of analogy with the computational framework of reinforcement learning (RL). We propose a psychology theory that is a computational synergy between analogy and RL, in which analogical comparison provides the RL learning algorithm with a measure of relational similarity, and RL provides feedback signals that can drive analogical learning. Simulation results support the power of this approach.",cs,AI,2017,How can integrating analogical reasoning with reinforcement learning enhance schema induction and attention mechanisms in cognitive tasks?
14,Occam's razor is insufficient to infer the preferences of irrational agents,"Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) attempts to infer human rewards or preferences from observed behavior. Since human planning systematically deviates from rationality, several approaches have been tried to account for specific human shortcomings. However, the general problem of inferring the reward function of an agent of unknown rationality has received little attention. Unlike the well-known ambiguity problems in IRL, this one is practically relevant but cannot be resolved by observing the agent's policy in enough environments. This paper shows (1) that a No Free Lunch result implies it is impossible to uniquely decompose a policy into a planning algorithm and reward function, and (2) that even with a reasonable simplicity prior/Occam's razor on the set of decompositions, we cannot distinguish between the true decomposition and others that lead to high regret. To address this, we need simple `normative' assumptions, which cannot be deduced exclusively from observations.",cs,AI,2017,"How can we effectively infer the reward functions of agents exhibiting irrational behavior when traditional methods, such as Occam's razor, fail to distinguish between multiple plausible decompositions of observed policies?"
15,Three IQs of AI Systems and their Testing Methods,"The rapid development of artificial intelligence has brought the artificial intelligence threat theory as well as the problem about how to evaluate the intelligence level of intelligent products. Both need to find a quantitative method to evaluate the intelligence level of intelligence systems, including human intelligence. Based on the standard intelligence system and the extended Von Neumann architecture, this paper proposes General IQ, Service IQ and Value IQ evaluation methods for intelligence systems, depending on different evaluation purposes. Among them, the General IQ of intelligence systems is to answer the question of whether the artificial intelligence can surpass the human intelligence, which is reflected in putting the intelligence systems on an equal status and conducting the unified evaluation. The Service IQ and Value IQ of intelligence systems are used to answer the question of how the intelligent products can better serve the human, reflecting the intelligence and required cost of each intelligence system as a product in the process of serving human.",cs,AI,2017,"How can the intelligence levels of artificial intelligence systems be quantitatively evaluated using the proposed General IQ, Service IQ, and Value IQ methods?"
16,Markov Game Modeling of Moving Target Defense for Strategic Detection of Threats in Cloud Networks,"The processing and storage of critical data in large-scale cloud networks necessitate the need for scalable security solutions. It has been shown that deploying all possible security measures incurs a cost on performance by using up valuable computing and networking resources which are the primary selling points for cloud service providers. Thus, there has been a recent interest in developing Moving Target Defense (MTD) mechanisms that helps one optimize the joint objective of maximizing security while ensuring that the impact on performance is minimized. Often, these techniques model the problem of multi-stage attacks by stealthy adversaries as a single-step attack detection game using graph connectivity measures as a heuristic to measure performance, thereby (1) losing out on valuable information that is inherently present in graph-theoretic models designed for large cloud networks, and (2) coming up with certain strategies that have asymmetric impacts on performance. In this work, we leverage knowledge in attack graphs of a cloud network in formulating a zero-sum Markov Game and use the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) to come up with meaningful utility values for this game. Then, we show that the optimal strategy of placing detecting mechanisms against an adversary is equivalent to computing the mixed Min-max Equilibrium of the Markov Game. We compare the gains obtained by using our method to other techniques presently used in cloud network security, thereby showing its effectiveness. Finally, we highlight how the method was used for a small real-world cloud system.",cs,AI,2018,"How can a zero-sum Markov Game model be effectively utilized to optimize Moving Target Defense strategies in cloud networks, balancing security measures with performance impacts?"
17,Differentiable Satisfiability and Differentiable Answer Set Programming for Sampling-Based Multi-Model Optimization,"We propose Differentiable Satisfiability and Differentiable Answer Set Programming (Differentiable SAT/ASP) for multi-model optimization. Models (answer sets or satisfying truth assignments) are sampled using a novel SAT/ASP solving approach which uses a gradient descent-based branching mechanism. Sampling proceeds until the value of a user-defined multi-model cost function reaches a given threshold. As major use cases for our approach we propose distribution-aware model sampling and expressive yet scalable probabilistic logic programming. As our main algorithmic approach to Differentiable SAT/ASP, we introduce an enhancement of the state-of-the-art CDNL/CDCL algorithm for SAT/ASP solving. Additionally, we present alternative algorithms which use an unmodified ASP solver (Clingo/clasp) and map the optimization task to conventional answer set optimization or use so-called propagators. We also report on the open source software DelSAT, a recent prototype implementation of our main algorithm, and on initial experimental results which indicate that DelSATs performance is, when applied to the use case of probabilistic logic inference, on par with Markov Logic Network (MLN) inference performance, despite having advantageous properties compared to MLNs, such as the ability to express inductive definitions and to work with probabilities as weights directly in all cases. Our experiments also indicate that our main algorithm is strongly superior in terms of performance compared to the presented alternative approaches which reduce a common instance of the general problem to regular SAT/ASP.",cs,AI,2018,"How can Differentiable Satisfiability and Differentiable Answer Set Programming be effectively utilized for multi-model optimization, and what advantages does this approach offer over traditional SAT/ASP solving methods?"
18,Mid-Level Visual Representations Improve Generalization and Sample Efficiency for Learning Visuomotor Policies,"How much does having visual priors about the world (e.g. the fact that the world is 3D) assist in learning to perform downstream motor tasks (e.g. delivering a package)? We study this question by integrating a generic perceptual skill set (e.g. a distance estimator, an edge detector, etc.) within a reinforcement learning framework--see Figure 1. This skill set (hereafter mid-level perception) provides the policy with a more processed state of the world compared to raw images.   We find that using a mid-level perception confers significant advantages over training end-to-end from scratch (i.e. not leveraging priors) in navigation-oriented tasks. Agents are able to generalize to situations where the from-scratch approach fails and training becomes significantly more sample efficient. However, we show that realizing these gains requires careful selection of the mid-level perceptual skills. Therefore, we refine our findings into an efficient max-coverage feature set that can be adopted in lieu of raw images. We perform our study in completely separate buildings for training and testing and compare against visually blind baseline policies and state-of-the-art feature learning methods.",cs,CV,2018,How do mid-level visual representations enhance generalization and sample efficiency in learning visuomotor policies compared to end-to-end training from raw images?
19,AIR5: Five Pillars of Artificial Intelligence Research,"In this article, we provide and overview of what we consider to be some of the most pressing research questions facing the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and computational intelligence (CI); with the latter focusing on algorithms that are inspired by various natural phenomena. We demarcate these questions using five unique Rs - namely, (i) rationalizability, (ii) resilience, (iii) reproducibility, (iv) realism, and (v) responsibility. Notably, just as air serves as the basic element of biological life, the term AIR5 - cumulatively referring to the five aforementioned Rs - is introduced herein to mark some of the basic elements of artificial life (supporting the sustained growth of AI and CI). A brief summary of each of the Rs is presented, highlighting their relevance as pillars of future research in this arena.",cs,AI,2018,"What are the key challenges and considerations represented by the five pillars of rationalizability, resilience, reproducibility, realism, and responsibility in advancing artificial intelligence and computational intelligence research?"
20,Advancing the State of the Art in Open Domain Dialog Systems through the Alexa Prize,"Building open domain conversational systems that allow users to have engaging conversations on topics of their choice is a challenging task. Alexa Prize was launched in 2016 to tackle the problem of achieving natural, sustained, coherent and engaging open-domain dialogs. In the second iteration of the competition in 2018, university teams advanced the state of the art by using context in dialog models, leveraging knowledge graphs for language understanding, handling complex utterances, building statistical and hierarchical dialog managers, and leveraging model-driven signals from user responses. The 2018 competition also included the provision of a suite of tools and models to the competitors including the CoBot (conversational bot) toolkit, topic and dialog act detection models, conversation evaluators, and a sensitive content detection model so that the competing teams could focus on building knowledge-rich, coherent and engaging multi-turn dialog systems. This paper outlines the advances developed by the university teams as well as the Alexa Prize team to achieve the common goal of advancing the science of Conversational AI. We address several key open-ended problems such as conversational speech recognition, open domain natural language understanding, commonsense reasoning, statistical dialog management, and dialog evaluation. These collaborative efforts have driven improved experiences by Alexa users to an average rating of 3.61, the median duration of 2 mins 18 seconds, and average turns to 14.6, increases of 14%, 92%, 54% respectively since the launch of the 2018 competition. For conversational speech recognition, we have improved our relative Word Error Rate by 55% and our relative Entity Error Rate by 34% since the launch of the Alexa Prize. Socialbots improved in quality significantly more rapidly in 2018, in part due to the release of the CoBot toolkit.",cs,CL,2018,"How can advancements in dialog models, knowledge graphs, and dialog management techniques improve the quality and engagement of open-domain conversational systems, as demonstrated by the outcomes of the Alexa Prize competition?"
21,Value of structural health information in partially observable stochastic environments,"Efficient integration of uncertain observations with decision-making optimization is key for prescribing informed intervention actions, able to preserve structural safety of deteriorating engineering systems. To this end, it is necessary that scheduling of inspection and monitoring strategies be objectively performed on the basis of their expected value-based gains that, among others, reflect quantitative metrics such as the Value of Information (VoI) and the Value of Structural Health Monitoring (VoSHM). In this work, we introduce and study the theoretical and computational foundations of the above metrics within the context of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), thus alluding to a broad class of decision-making problems of partially observable stochastic deteriorating environments that can be modeled as POMDPs. Step-wise and life-cycle VoI and VoSHM definitions are devised and their bounds are analyzed as per the properties stemming from the Bellman equation and the resulting optimal value function. It is shown that a POMDP policy inherently leverages the notion of VoI to guide observational actions in an optimal way at every decision step, and that the permanent or intermittent information provided by SHM or inspection visits, respectively, can only improve the cost of this policy in the long-term, something that is not necessarily true under locally optimal policies, typically adopted in decision-making of structures and infrastructure. POMDP solutions are derived based on point-based value iteration methods, and the various definitions are quantified in stationary and non-stationary deteriorating environments, with both infinite and finite planning horizons, featuring single- or multi-component engineering systems.",cs,LG,2019,How can the integration of Value of Information (VoI) and Value of Structural Health Monitoring (VoSHM) metrics within Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) optimize decision-making for inspection and monitoring strategies in deteriorating engineering systems?
22,Discrete and Continuous Action Representation for Practical RL in Video Games,"While most current research in Reinforcement Learning (RL) focuses on improving the performance of the algorithms in controlled environments, the use of RL under constraints like those met in the video game industry is rarely studied. Operating under such constraints, we propose Hybrid SAC, an extension of the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm able to handle discrete, continuous and parameterized actions in a principled way. We show that Hybrid SAC can successfully solve a highspeed driving task in one of our games, and is competitive with the state-of-the-art on parameterized actions benchmark tasks. We also explore the impact of using normalizing flows to enrich the expressiveness of the policy at minimal computational cost, and identify a potential undesired effect of SAC when used with normalizing flows, that may be addressed by optimizing a different objective.",cs,LG,2019,"How can Hybrid SAC be effectively utilized to improve Reinforcement Learning performance in video games by integrating discrete, continuous, and parameterized action representations while addressing the challenges posed by operational constraints?"
23,Tag-less Back-Translation,"An effective method to generate a large number of parallel sentences for training improved neural machine translation (NMT) systems is the use of the back-translations of the target-side monolingual data. The standard back-translation method has been shown to be unable to efficiently utilize the available huge amount of existing monolingual data because of the inability of translation models to differentiate between the authentic and synthetic parallel data during training. Tagging, or using gates, has been used to enable translation models to distinguish between synthetic and authentic data, improving standard back-translation and also enabling the use of iterative back-translation on language pairs that underperformed using standard back-translation. In this work, we approach back-translation as a domain adaptation problem, eliminating the need for explicit tagging. In the approach -- \emph{tag-less back-translation} -- the synthetic and authentic parallel data are treated as out-of-domain and in-domain data respectively and, through pre-training and fine-tuning, the translation model is shown to be able to learn more efficiently from them during training. Experimental results have shown that the approach outperforms the standard and tagged back-translation approaches on low resource English-Vietnamese and English-German neural machine translation.",cs,CL,2019,How can the elimination of explicit tagging in back-translation improve the efficiency of neural machine translation models when utilizing synthetic and authentic parallel data?
24,Towards Neural-Guided Program Synthesis for Linear Temporal Logic Specifications,"Synthesizing a program that realizes a logical specification is a classical problem in computer science. We examine a particular type of program synthesis, where the objective is to synthesize a strategy that reacts to a potentially adversarial environment while ensuring that all executions satisfy a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) specification. Unfortunately, exact methods to solve so-called LTL synthesis via logical inference do not scale. In this work, we cast LTL synthesis as an optimization problem. We employ a neural network to learn a Q-function that is then used to guide search, and to construct programs that are subsequently verified for correctness. Our method is unique in combining search with deep learning to realize LTL synthesis. In our experiments the learned Q-function provides effective guidance for synthesis problems with relatively small specifications.",cs,AI,2019,How can neural networks be effectively utilized to optimize the program synthesis process for Linear Temporal Logic specifications in adversarial environments?
25,Explain Your Move: Understanding Agent Actions Using Specific and Relevant Feature Attribution,"As deep reinforcement learning (RL) is applied to more tasks, there is a need to visualize and understand the behavior of learned agents. Saliency maps explain agent behavior by highlighting the features of the input state that are most relevant for the agent in taking an action. Existing perturbation-based approaches to compute saliency often highlight regions of the input that are not relevant to the action taken by the agent. Our proposed approach, SARFA (Specific and Relevant Feature Attribution), generates more focused saliency maps by balancing two aspects (specificity and relevance) that capture different desiderata of saliency. The first captures the impact of perturbation on the relative expected reward of the action to be explained. The second downweighs irrelevant features that alter the relative expected rewards of actions other than the action to be explained. We compare SARFA with existing approaches on agents trained to play board games (Chess and Go) and Atari games (Breakout, Pong and Space Invaders). We show through illustrative examples (Chess, Atari, Go), human studies (Chess), and automated evaluation methods (Chess) that SARFA generates saliency maps that are more interpretable for humans than existing approaches. For the code release and demo videos, see https://nikaashpuri.github.io/sarfa-saliency/.",cs,CV,2019,How can the SARFA method improve the interpretability of saliency maps in deep reinforcement learning agents by balancing specificity and relevance in feature attribution?
26,RADDLE: An Evaluation Benchmark and Analysis Platform for Robust Task-oriented Dialog Systems,"For task-oriented dialog systems to be maximally useful, it must be able to process conversations in a way that is (1) generalizable with a small number of training examples for new task domains, and (2) robust to user input in various styles, modalities or domains. In pursuit of these goals, we introduce the RADDLE benchmark, a collection of corpora and tools for evaluating the performance of models across a diverse set of domains. By including tasks with limited training data, RADDLE is designed to favor and encourage models with a strong generalization ability. RADDLE also includes a diagnostic checklist that facilitates detailed robustness analysis in aspects such as language variations, speech errors, unseen entities, and out-of-domain utterances. We evaluate recent state-of-the-art systems based on pre-training and fine-tuning, and find that grounded pre-training on heterogeneous dialog corpora performs better than training a separate model per domain. Overall, existing models are less than satisfactory in robustness evaluation, which suggests opportunities for future improvement.",cs,CL,2020,How can the RADDLE benchmark be utilized to enhance the generalization and robustness of task-oriented dialog systems across diverse domains and user inputs?
27,Longitudinal diffusion MRI analysis using Segis-Net: a single-step deep-learning framework for simultaneous segmentation and registration,"This work presents a single-step deep-learning framework for longitudinal image analysis, coined Segis-Net. To optimally exploit information available in longitudinal data, this method concurrently learns a multi-class segmentation and nonlinear registration. Segmentation and registration are modeled using a convolutional neural network and optimized simultaneously for their mutual benefit. An objective function that optimizes spatial correspondence for the segmented structures across time-points is proposed. We applied Segis-Net to the analysis of white matter tracts from N=8045 longitudinal brain MRI datasets of 3249 elderly individuals. Segis-Net approach showed a significant increase in registration accuracy, spatio-temporal segmentation consistency, and reproducibility comparing with two multistage pipelines. This also led to a significant reduction in the sample-size that would be required to achieve the same statistical power in analyzing tract-specific measures. Thus, we expect that Segis-Net can serve as a new reliable tool to support longitudinal imaging studies to investigate macro- and microstructural brain changes over time.",cs,CV,2020,How does the Segis-Net deep-learning framework improve the accuracy and consistency of segmentation and registration in longitudinal diffusion MRI analysis compared to traditional multistage pipelines?
28,GAKP: GRU Association and Kalman Prediction for Multiple Object Tracking,"Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) has been a useful yet challenging task in many real-world applications such as video surveillance, intelligent retail, and smart city. The challenge is how to model long-term temporal dependencies in an efficient manner. Some recent works employ Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to obtain good performance, which, however, requires a large amount of training data. In this paper, we proposed a novel tracking method that integrates the auto-tuning Kalman method for prediction and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and achieves a near-optimum with a small amount of training data. Experimental results show that our new algorithm can achieve competitive performance on the challenging MOT benchmark, and faster and more robust than the state-of-the-art RNN-based online MOT algorithms.",cs,CV,2020,How can the integration of Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and auto-tuning Kalman prediction improve the efficiency and accuracy of multiple object tracking with limited training data?
29,LookHops: light multi-order convolution and pooling for graph classification,"Convolution and pooling are the key operations to learn hierarchical representation for graph classification, where more expressive $k$-order($k>1$) method requires more computation cost, limiting the further applications. In this paper, we investigate the strategy of selecting $k$ via neighborhood information gain and propose light $k$-order convolution and pooling requiring fewer parameters while improving the performance. Comprehensive and fair experiments through six graph classification benchmarks show: 1) the performance improvement is consistent to the $k$-order information gain. 2) the proposed convolution requires fewer parameters while providing competitive results. 3) the proposed pooling outperforms SOTA algorithms in terms of efficiency and performance.",cs,LG,2020,How can light multi-order convolution and pooling methods be optimized to enhance graph classification performance while reducing computational costs and parameter requirements?
30,Multiple Plans are Better than One: Diverse Stochastic Planning,"In planning problems, it is often challenging to fully model the desired specifications. In particular, in human-robot interaction, such difficulty may arise due to human's preferences that are either private or complex to model. Consequently, the resulting objective function can only partially capture the specifications and optimizing that may lead to poor performance with respect to the true specifications. Motivated by this challenge, we formulate a problem, called diverse stochastic planning, that aims to generate a set of representative -- small and diverse -- behaviors that are near-optimal with respect to the known objective. In particular, the problem aims to compute a set of diverse and near-optimal policies for systems modeled by a Markov decision process. We cast the problem as a constrained nonlinear optimization for which we propose a solution relying on the Frank-Wolfe method. We then prove that the proposed solution converges to a stationary point and demonstrate its efficacy in several planning problems.",cs,RO,2020,How can diverse stochastic planning improve the generation of representative and near-optimal behaviors in human-robot interaction when the true specifications are complex or partially unknown?
31,RheFrameDetect: A Text Classification System for Automatic Detection of Rhetorical Frames in AI from Open Sources,"Rhetorical Frames in AI can be thought of as expressions that describe AI development as a competition between two or more actors, such as governments or companies. Examples of such Frames include robotic arms race, AI rivalry, technological supremacy, cyberwarfare dominance and 5G race. Detection of Rhetorical Frames from open sources can help us track the attitudes of governments or companies towards AI, specifically whether attitudes are becoming more cooperative or competitive over time. Given the rapidly increasing volumes of open sources (online news media, twitter, blogs), it is difficult for subject matter experts to identify Rhetorical Frames in (near) real-time. Moreover, these sources are in general unstructured (noisy) and therefore, detecting Frames from these sources will require state-of-the-art text classification techniques. In this paper, we develop RheFrameDetect, a text classification system for (near) real-time capture of Rhetorical Frames from open sources. Given an input document, RheFrameDetect employs text classification techniques at multiple levels (document level and paragraph level) to identify all occurrences of Frames used in the discussion of AI. We performed extensive evaluation of the text classification techniques used in RheFrameDetect against human annotated Frames from multiple news sources. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of RheFrameDetect, we show multiple case studies depicting the Frames identified by RheFrameDetect compared against human annotated Frames.",cs,CL,2021,How can RheFrameDetect effectively utilize advanced text classification techniques to automatically identify and analyze rhetorical frames related to AI in unstructured open-source data?
32,From Behavioral Theories to Econometrics: Inferring Preferences of Human Agents from Data on Repeated Interactions,"We consider the problem of estimating preferences of human agents from data of strategic systems where the agents repeatedly interact. Recently, it was demonstrated that a new estimation method called ""quantal regret"" produces more accurate estimates for human agents than the classic approach that assumes that agents are rational and reach a Nash equilibrium; however, this method has not been compared to methods that take into account behavioral aspects of human play. In this paper we leverage equilibrium concepts from behavioral economics for this purpose and ask how well they perform compared to the quantal regret and Nash equilibrium methods. We develop four estimation methods based on established behavioral equilibrium models to infer the utilities of human agents from observed data of normal-form games. The equilibrium models we study are quantal-response equilibrium, action-sampling equilibrium, payoff-sampling equilibrium, and impulse-balance equilibrium. We show that in some of these concepts the inference is achieved analytically via closed formulas, while in the others the inference is achieved only algorithmically. We use experimental data of 2x2 games to evaluate the estimation success of these behavioral equilibrium methods. The results show that the estimates they produce are more accurate than the estimates of the Nash equilibrium. The comparison with the quantal-regret method shows that the behavioral methods have better hit rates, but the quantal-regret method performs better in terms of the overall mean squared error, and we discuss the differences between the methods.",cs,GT,2021,How do behavioral equilibrium models compare to the quantal regret and Nash equilibrium methods in accurately estimating the preferences of human agents from data on repeated interactions in strategic systems?
33,A Survey of Deep Learning Techniques for Dynamic Branch Prediction,"Branch prediction is an architectural feature that speeds up the execution of branch instruction on pipeline processors and reduces the cost of branching. Recent advancements of Deep Learning (DL) in the post Moore's Law era is accelerating areas of automated chip design, low-power computer architectures, and much more. Traditional computer architecture design and algorithms could benefit from dynamic predictors based on deep learning algorithms which learns from experience by optimizing its parameters on large number of data. In this survey paper, we focus on traditional branch prediction algorithms, analyzes its limitations, and presents a literature survey of how deep learning techniques can be applied to create dynamic branch predictors capable of predicting conditional branch instructions. Prior surveys in this field focus on dynamic branch prediction techniques based on neural network perceptrons. We plan to improve the survey based on latest research in DL and advanced Machine Learning (ML) based branch predictors.",cs,AR,2021,"How can deep learning techniques be effectively applied to enhance dynamic branch prediction in pipeline processors, addressing the limitations of traditional algorithms?"
34,On some Foundational Aspects of Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence,"The burgeoning of AI has prompted recommendations that AI techniques should be ""human-centered"". However, there is no clear definition of what is meant by Human Centered Artificial Intelligence, or for short, HCAI. This paper aims to improve this situation by addressing some foundational aspects of HCAI. To do so, we introduce the term HCAI agent to refer to any physical or software computational agent equipped with AI components and that interacts and/or collaborates with humans. This article identifies five main conceptual components that participate in an HCAI agent: Observations, Requirements, Actions, Explanations and Models. We see the notion of HCAI agent, together with its components and functions, as a way to bridge the technical and non-technical discussions on human-centered AI. In this paper, we focus our analysis on scenarios consisting of a single agent operating in dynamic environments in presence of humans.",cs,AI,2021,What are the foundational components and conceptual framework necessary to define and understand Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) agents in dynamic human-interactive environments?
35,Pose Estimation of Specific Rigid Objects,"In this thesis, we address the problem of estimating the 6D pose of rigid objects from a single RGB or RGB-D input image, assuming that 3D models of the objects are available. This problem is of great importance to many application fields such as robotic manipulation, augmented reality, and autonomous driving. First, we propose EPOS, a method for 6D object pose estimation from an RGB image. The key idea is to represent an object by compact surface fragments and predict the probability distribution of corresponding fragments at each pixel of the input image by a neural network. Each pixel is linked with a data-dependent number of fragments, which allows systematic handling of symmetries, and the 6D poses are estimated from the links by a RANSAC-based fitting method. EPOS outperformed all RGB and most RGB-D and D methods on several standard datasets. Second, we present HashMatch, an RGB-D method that slides a window over the input image and searches for a match against templates, which are pre-generated by rendering 3D object models in different orientations. The method applies a cascade of evaluation stages to each window location, which avoids exhaustive matching against all templates. Third, we propose ObjectSynth, an approach to synthesize photorealistic images of 3D object models for training methods based on neural networks. The images yield substantial improvements compared to commonly used images of objects rendered on top of random photographs. Fourth, we introduce T-LESS, the first dataset for 6D object pose estimation that includes 3D models and RGB-D images of industry-relevant objects. Fifth, we define BOP, a benchmark that captures the status quo in the field. BOP comprises eleven datasets in a unified format, an evaluation methodology, an online evaluation system, and public challenges held at international workshops organized at the ICCV and ECCV conferences.",cs,CV,2021,How can the 6D pose estimation of rigid objects be effectively achieved from single RGB or RGB-D images using neural network-based methods and 3D object models?
36,Rethinking with Retrieval: Faithful Large Language Model Inference,"Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, the stored knowledge in these models may inevitably be incomplete, out-of-date, or incorrect. This motivates the need to utilize external knowledge to assist LLMs. Unfortunately, current methods for incorporating external knowledge often require additional training or fine-tuning, which can be costly and may not be feasible for LLMs. To address this issue, we propose a novel post-processing approach, rethinking with retrieval (RR), which retrieves relevant external knowledge based on the decomposed reasoning steps obtained from the chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. This lightweight approach does not require additional training or fine-tuning and is not limited by the input length of LLMs. We evaluate the effectiveness of RR through extensive experiments with GPT-3 on three complex reasoning tasks: commonsense reasoning, temporal reasoning, and tabular reasoning. Our results show that RR can produce more faithful explanations and improve the performance of LLMs.",cs,CL,2022,How can the integration of external knowledge through a post-processing retrieval approach enhance the accuracy and reliability of large language models in complex reasoning tasks without requiring additional training or fine-tuning?
37,How Do Deepfakes Move? Motion Magnification for Deepfake Source Detection,"With the proliferation of deep generative models, deepfakes are improving in quality and quantity everyday. However, there are subtle authenticity signals in pristine videos, not replicated by SOTA GANs. We contrast the movement in deepfakes and authentic videos by motion magnification towards building a generalized deepfake source detector. The sub-muscular motion in faces has different interpretations per different generative models which is reflected in their generative residue. Our approach exploits the difference between real motion and the amplified GAN fingerprints, by combining deep and traditional motion magnification, to detect whether a video is fake and its source generator if so. Evaluating our approach on two multi-source datasets, we obtain 97.17% and 94.03% for video source detection. We compare against the prior deepfake source detector and other complex architectures. We also analyze the importance of magnification amount, phase extraction window, backbone network architecture, sample counts, and sample lengths. Finally, we report our results for different skin tones to assess the bias.",cs,CV,2022,"How can motion magnification techniques be utilized to differentiate between deepfake videos and authentic videos, and what factors influence the effectiveness of deepfake source detection?"
38,Matrix Multiplication: Verifying Strong Uniquely Solvable Puzzles,"Cohn and Umans proposed a framework for developing fast matrix multiplication algorithms based on the embedding computation in certain groups algebras. In subsequent work with Kleinberg and Szegedy, they connected this to the search for combinatorial objects called strong uniquely solvable puzzles (strong USPs). We begin a systematic computer-aided search for these objects. We develop and implement constraint-based algorithms build on reductions to $\mathrm{SAT}$ and $\mathrm{IP}$ to verify that puzzles are strong USPs, and to search for large strong USPs. We produce tight bounds on the maximum size of a strong USP for width $k \le 5$, construct puzzles of small width that are larger than previous work, and improve the upper bounds on strong USP size for $k \le 12$. Although our work only deals with puzzles of small-constant width, the strong USPs we find imply matrix multiplication algorithms that run in $O(n^\omega)$ time with exponent $\omega \le 2.66$. While our algorithms do not beat the fastest algorithms, our work provides evidence and, perhaps, a path to finding families of strong USPs that imply matrix multiplication algorithms that are more efficient than those currently known.",cs,CC,2022,"How can constraint-based algorithms be effectively utilized to identify and verify strong uniquely solvable puzzles, and what implications do these findings have for improving the efficiency of matrix multiplication algorithms?"
39,Effectiveness of Deep Image Embedding Clustering Methods on Tabular Data,"Deep learning methods in the literature are commonly benchmarked on image data sets, which may not be suitable or effective baselines for non-image tabular data. In this paper, we take a data-centric view to perform one of the first studies on deep embedding clustering of tabular data. Eight clustering and state-of-the-art embedding clustering methods proposed for image data sets are tested on seven tabular data sets. Our results reveal that a traditional clustering method ranks second out of eight methods and is superior to most deep embedding clustering baselines. Our observation aligns with the literature that conventional machine learning of tabular data is still a robust approach against deep learning. Therefore, state-of-the-art embedding clustering methods should consider data-centric customization of learning architectures to become competitive baselines for tabular data.",cs,LG,2022,How do deep image embedding clustering methods perform when applied to tabular data compared to traditional clustering methods?
40,MEAformer: Multi-modal Entity Alignment Transformer for Meta Modality Hybrid,"Multi-modal entity alignment (MMEA) aims to discover identical entities across different knowledge graphs (KGs) whose entities are associated with relevant images. However, current MMEA algorithms rely on KG-level modality fusion strategies for multi-modal entity representation, which ignores the variations of modality preferences of different entities, thus compromising robustness against noise in modalities such as blurry images and relations. This paper introduces MEAformer, a multi-modal entity alignment transformer approach for meta modality hybrid, which dynamically predicts the mutual correlation coefficients among modalities for more fine-grained entity-level modality fusion and alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our model not only achieves SOTA performance in multiple training scenarios, including supervised, unsupervised, iterative, and low-resource settings, but also has a limited number of parameters, efficient runtime, and interpretability. Our code is available at https://github.com/zjukg/MEAformer.",cs,AI,2022,How can the MEAformer model improve multi-modal entity alignment by dynamically predicting mutual correlation coefficients among modalities to enhance robustness against noise in knowledge graphs?
41,FedLED: Label-Free Equipment Fault Diagnosis with Vertical Federated Transfer Learning,"Intelligent equipment fault diagnosis based on Federated Transfer Learning (FTL) attracts considerable attention from both academia and industry. It allows real-world industrial agents with limited samples to construct a fault diagnosis model without jeopardizing their raw data privacy. Existing approaches, however, can neither address the intense sample heterogeneity caused by different working conditions of practical agents, nor the extreme fault label scarcity, even zero, of newly deployed equipment. To address these issues, we present FedLED, the first unsupervised vertical FTL equipment fault diagnosis method, where knowledge of the unlabeled target domain is further exploited for effective unsupervised model transfer. Results of extensive experiments using data of real equipment monitoring demonstrate that FedLED obviously outperforms SOTA approaches in terms of both diagnosis accuracy (up to 4.13 times) and generality. We expect our work to inspire further study on label-free equipment fault diagnosis systematically enhanced by target domain knowledge.",cs,LG,2023,How can unsupervised vertical federated transfer learning be effectively utilized to improve equipment fault diagnosis in scenarios with limited labeled data and heterogeneous sample distributions?
42,SynCDR : Training Cross Domain Retrieval Models with Synthetic Data,"In cross-domain retrieval, a model is required to identify images from the same semantic category across two visual domains. For instance, given a sketch of an object, a model needs to retrieve a real image of it from an online store's catalog. A standard approach for such a problem is learning a feature space of images where Euclidean distances reflect similarity. Even without human annotations, which may be expensive to acquire, prior methods function reasonably well using unlabeled images for training. Our problem constraint takes this further to scenarios where the two domains do not necessarily share any common categories in training data. This can occur when the two domains in question come from different versions of some biometric sensor recording identities of different people. We posit a simple solution, which is to generate synthetic data to fill in these missing category examples across domains. This, we do via category preserving translation of images from one visual domain to another. We compare approaches specifically trained for this translation for a pair of domains, as well as those that can use large-scale pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models via prompts, and find that the latter can generate better replacement synthetic data, leading to more accurate cross-domain retrieval models. Our best SynCDR model can outperform prior art by up to 15\%. Code for our work is available at https://github.com/samarth4149/SynCDR .",cs,CV,2023,How can synthetic data generation improve the performance of cross-domain retrieval models when training data from common categories is unavailable?
43,DREAM: Debugging and Repairing AutoML Pipelines,"Deep Learning models have become an integrated component of modern software systems. In response to the challenge of model design, researchers proposed Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) systems, which automatically search for model architecture and hyperparameters for a given task. Like other software systems, existing AutoML systems suffer from bugs. We identify two common and severe bugs in AutoML, performance bug (i.e., searching for the desired model takes an unreasonably long time) and ineffective search bug (i.e., AutoML systems are not able to find an accurate enough model). After analyzing the workflow of AutoML, we observe that existing AutoML systems overlook potential opportunities in search space, search method, and search feedback, which results in performance and ineffective search bugs. Based on our analysis, we design and implement DREAM, an automatic debugging and repairing system for AutoML systems. It monitors the process of AutoML to collect detailed feedback and automatically repairs bugs by expanding search space and leveraging a feedback-driven search strategy. Our evaluation results show that DREAM can effectively and efficiently repair AutoML bugs.",cs,SE,2023,How can the debugging and repair of performance and ineffective search bugs in Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) systems be effectively achieved through enhanced search space and feedback-driven strategies?
44,"Deep Learning for Code Intelligence: Survey, Benchmark and Toolkit","Code intelligence leverages machine learning techniques to extract knowledge from extensive code corpora, with the aim of developing intelligent tools to improve the quality and productivity of computer programming. Currently, there is already a thriving research community focusing on code intelligence, with efforts ranging from software engineering, machine learning, data mining, natural language processing, and programming languages. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive literature review on deep learning for code intelligence, from the aspects of code representation learning, deep learning techniques, and application tasks. We also benchmark several state-of-the-art neural models for code intelligence, and provide an open-source toolkit tailored for the rapid prototyping of deep-learning-based code intelligence models. In particular, we inspect the existing code intelligence models under the basis of code representation learning, and provide a comprehensive overview to enhance comprehension of the present state of code intelligence. Furthermore, we publicly release the source code and data resources to provide the community with a ready-to-use benchmark, which can facilitate the evaluation and comparison of existing and future code intelligence models (https://xcodemind.github.io). At last, we also point out several challenging and promising directions for future research.",cs,SE,2023,"What are the current advancements and challenges in applying deep learning techniques to code intelligence, and how can a standardized benchmarking toolkit enhance the evaluation and development of these models?"
45,Coding for Gaussian Two-Way Channels: Linear and Learning-Based Approaches,"Although user cooperation cannot improve the capacity of Gaussian two-way channels (GTWCs) with independent noises, it can improve communication reliability. In this work, we aim to enhance and balance the communication reliability in GTWCs by minimizing the sum of error probabilities via joint design of encoders and decoders at the users. We first formulate general encoding/decoding functions, where the user cooperation is captured by the coupling of user encoding processes. The coupling effect renders the encoder/decoder design non-trivial, requiring effective decoding to capture this effect, as well as efficient power management at the encoders within power constraints. To address these challenges, we propose two different two-way coding strategies: linear coding and learning-based coding. For linear coding, we propose optimal linear decoding and discuss new insights on encoding regarding user cooperation to balance reliability. We then propose an efficient algorithm for joint encoder/decoder design. For learning-based coding, we introduce a novel recurrent neural network (RNN)-based coding architecture, where we propose interactive RNNs and a power control layer for encoding, and we incorporate bi-directional RNNs with an attention mechanism for decoding. Through simulations, we show that our two-way coding methodologies outperform conventional channel coding schemes (that do not utilize user cooperation) significantly in sum-error performance. We also demonstrate that our linear coding excels at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), while our RNN-based coding performs best at low SNRs. We further investigate our two-way coding strategies in terms of power distribution, two-way coding benefit, different coding rates, and block-length gain.",cs,IT,2023,"How can joint design of encoders and decoders in Gaussian two-way channels enhance communication reliability while minimizing error probabilities, and what are the comparative advantages of linear versus learning-based coding strategies in varying signal-to-noise ratio conditions?"
46,Temporal Information Reconstruction and Non-Aligned Residual in Spiking Neural Networks for Speech Classification,"Recently, it can be noticed that most models based on spiking neural networks (SNNs) only use a same level temporal resolution to deal with speech classification problems, which makes these models cannot learn the information of input data at different temporal scales. Additionally, owing to the different time lengths of the data before and after the sub-modules of many models, the effective residual connections cannot be applied to optimize the training processes of these models.To solve these problems, on the one hand, we reconstruct the temporal dimension of the audio spectrum to propose a novel method named as Temporal Reconstruction (TR) by referring the hierarchical processing process of the human brain for understanding speech. Then, the reconstructed SNN model with TR can learn the information of input data at different temporal scales and model more comprehensive semantic information from audio data because it enables the networks to learn the information of input data at different temporal resolutions. On the other hand, we propose the Non-Aligned Residual (NAR) method by analyzing the audio data, which allows the residual connection can be used in two audio data with different time lengths. We have conducted plentiful experiments on the Spiking Speech Commands (SSC), the Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD), and the Google Speech Commands v0.02 (GSC) datasets. According to the experiment results, we have achieved the state-of-the-art (SOTA) result 81.02\% on SSC for the test classification accuracy of all SNN models, and we have obtained the SOTA result 96.04\% on SHD for the classification accuracy of all models.",cs,SD,2024,How can the integration of Temporal Reconstruction and Non-Aligned Residual methods in spiking neural networks enhance speech classification performance by effectively capturing information at varying temporal scales?
47,Re-evaluating Automatic LLM System Ranking for Alignment with Human Preference,"Evaluating and ranking the capabilities of different LLMs is crucial for understanding their performance and alignment with human preferences. Due to the high cost and time-consuming nature of human evaluations, an automatic LLM bencher (i.e., an automatic evaluation framework that aims to rank LLMs based on their alignment with human preferences) is indispensable. An automatic LLM bencher consists of four components: the input set (e.g., a user instruction), the evaluation model (e.g., an LLM), the evaluation type (e.g., pairwise comparison), and the aggregation method (e.g., the ELO rating system). However, previous work has not thoroughly explored how to select these components or how their different combinations influence the results. In this work, through controlled experiments, we provide a series of recommendations on how to choose each component to better automate the evaluation of LLMs. Furthermore, we discovered that when evaluating LLMs with similar performance, the performance of the automatic LLM bencher declines sharply, underscoring the limitations of current benchers and calling for future work. Lastly, we found that the evaluation models' performance at the instance level (e.g., the accuracy of selecting the best output) does not always align with their effectiveness when used as a component of a bencher, highlighting the importance of dedicated system-level evaluation of benchers.",cs,CL,2024,How can the selection and combination of components in an automatic LLM evaluation framework be optimized to improve alignment with human preferences and enhance the reliability of LLM rankings?
48,Are the Values of LLMs Structurally Aligned with Humans? A Causal Perspective,"As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into critical applications, aligning their behavior with human values presents significant challenges. Current methods, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), typically focus on a limited set of coarse-grained values and are resource-intensive. Moreover, the correlations between these values remain implicit, leading to unclear explanations for value-steering outcomes. Our work argues that a latent causal value graph underlies the value dimensions of LLMs and that, despite alignment training, this structure remains significantly different from human value systems. We leverage these causal value graphs to guide two lightweight value-steering methods: role-based prompting and sparse autoencoder (SAE) steering, effectively mitigating unexpected side effects. Furthermore, SAE provides a more fine-grained approach to value steering. Experiments on Gemma-2B-IT and Llama3-8B-IT demonstrate the effectiveness and controllability of our methods.",cs,CL,2024,"How can causal value graphs be utilized to enhance the alignment of large language models with human values, and what are the implications of structural differences between these value systems?"
49,Exploring the Implicit Semantic Ability of Multimodal Large Language Models: A Pilot Study on Entity Set Expansion,"The rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has brought significant improvements to a wide range of tasks in real-world applications. However, LLMs still exhibit certain limitations in extracting implicit semantic information. In this paper, we apply MLLMs to the Multi-modal Entity Set Expansion (MESE) task, which aims to expand a handful of seed entities with new entities belonging to the same semantic class, and multi-modal information is provided with each entity. We explore the capabilities of MLLMs to understand implicit semantic information at the entity-level granularity through the MESE task, introducing a listwise ranking method LUSAR that maps local scores to global rankings. Our LUSAR demonstrates significant improvements in MLLM's performance on the MESE task, marking the first use of generative MLLM for ESE tasks and extending the applicability of listwise ranking.",cs,CL,2024,"How effectively can multimodal large language models extract and utilize implicit semantic information for entity set expansion tasks, and what improvements can be achieved through the application of a listwise ranking method?"
50,An Overview and Discussion on Using Large Language Models for Implementation Generation of Solutions to Open-Ended Problems,"Large Language Models offer new opportunities to devise automated implementation generation methods that can tackle problem solving activities beyond traditional methods, which require algorithmic specifications and can use only static domain knowledge, like performance metrics and libraries of basic building blocks. Large Language Models could support creating new methods to support problem solving activities for open-ended problems, like problem framing, exploring possible solving approaches, feature elaboration and combination, more advanced implementation assessment, and handling unexpected situations.

51,Boosting Instruction Following at Scale,"A typical approach developers follow to influence an LLM's behavior in an application is through careful manipulation of the prompt, such as by adding or modifying instructions. However, merely adding more instructions provides little assurance that they will actually be followed. We introduce Instruction Boosting as a post-generation method to increase the reliability of LLM prompt instructions. We show that Instruction Boosting improves the instruction following rate by up to 7 points for two instructions and up to 4 points for ten instructions. To demonstrate these results we introduce SCALEDIF, a benchmark with a scaled instruction volume of up to ten instructions per data sample. We also present an analysis of the commonly observed trend that performance degrades as more instructions are added. We show that an important factor contributing to this trend is the degree of tension and conflict that arises as the number of instructions is increased. We contribute a quantitative conflict scoring tool that explains the observed performance trends and provides feedback to developers on the impact that additional prompt instructions have on a model's performance.",cs,AI,2025,"How can Instruction Boosting enhance the reliability of instruction following in large language models, particularly in the context of increasing instruction volume and managing conflicts among instructions?"
52,DEXTER: Diffusion-Guided EXplanations with TExtual Reasoning for Vision Models,"Understanding and explaining the behavior of machine learning models is essential for building transparent and trustworthy AI systems. We introduce DEXTER, a data-free framework that employs diffusion models and large language models to generate global, textual explanations of visual classifiers. DEXTER operates by optimizing text prompts to synthesize class-conditional images that strongly activate a target classifier. These synthetic samples are then used to elicit detailed natural language reports that describe class-specific decision patterns and biases. Unlike prior work, DEXTER enables natural language explanation about a classifier's decision process without access to training data or ground-truth labels. We demonstrate DEXTER's flexibility across three tasks-activation maximization, slice discovery and debiasing, and bias explanation-each illustrating its ability to uncover the internal mechanisms of visual classifiers. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including a user study, show that DEXTER produces accurate, interpretable outputs. Experiments on ImageNet, Waterbirds, CelebA, and FairFaces confirm that DEXTER outperforms existing approaches in global model explanation and class-level bias reporting. Code is available at https://github.com/perceivelab/dexter.",cs,CV,2025,How can DEXTER leverage diffusion models and large language models to generate accurate and interpretable textual explanations of visual classifiers without relying on training data or ground-truth labels?
53,Beyond Multi-Token Prediction: Pretraining LLMs with Future Summaries,"Next-token prediction (NTP) has driven the success of large language models (LLMs), but it struggles with long-horizon reasoning, planning, and creative writing, with these limitations largely attributed to teacher-forced training. Multi-token prediction (MTP) partially mitigates these issues by predicting several future tokens at once, but it mostly captures short-range dependencies and offers limited improvement. We propose future summary prediction (FSP), which trains an auxiliary head to predict a compact representation of the long-term future, preserving information relevant for long-form generations. We explore two variants of FSP: handcrafted summaries, for example, a bag of words summary of the future of the sequence, and learned summaries, which use embeddings produced by a reverse language model trained from right to left. Large-scale pretraining experiments (3B and 8B-parameter models) demonstrate that FSP provides improvements over both NTP and MTP across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks.",cs,LG,2025,How does future summary prediction (FSP) enhance the long-horizon reasoning and creative writing capabilities of large language models compared to traditional next-token and multi-token prediction methods?
54,LLM Agents Beyond Utility: An Open-Ended Perspective,"Recent LLM agents have made great use of chain of thought reasoning and function calling. As their capabilities grow, an important question arises: can this software represent not only a smart problem-solving tool, but an entity in its own right, that can plan, design immediate tasks, and reason toward broader, more ambiguous goals? To study this question, we adopt an open-ended experimental setting where we augment a pretrained LLM agent with the ability to generate its own tasks, accumulate knowledge, and interact extensively with its environment. We study the resulting open-ended agent qualitatively. It can reliably follow complex multi-step instructions, store and reuse information across runs, and propose and solve its own tasks, though it remains sensitive to prompt design, prone to repetitive task generation, and unable to form self-representations. These findings illustrate both the promise and current limits of adapting pretrained LLMs toward open-endedness, and point to future directions for training agents to manage memory, explore productively, and pursue abstract long-term goals.",cs,AI,2025,"How can pretrained LLM agents be enhanced to autonomously generate tasks, accumulate knowledge, and pursue broader, ambiguous goals while addressing their current limitations in self-representation and task generation?"
55,pi-Flow: Policy-Based Few-Step Generation via Imitation Distillation,"Few-step diffusion or flow-based generative models typically distill a velocity-predicting teacher into a student that predicts a shortcut towards denoised data. This format mismatch has led to complex distillation procedures that often suffer from a quality-diversity trade-off. To address this, we propose policy-based flow models ($\pi$-Flow). $\pi$-Flow modifies the output layer of a student flow model to predict a network-free policy at one timestep. The policy then produces dynamic flow velocities at future substeps with negligible overhead, enabling fast and accurate ODE integration on these substeps without extra network evaluations. To match the policy's ODE trajectory to the teacher's, we introduce a novel imitation distillation approach, which matches the policy's velocity to the teacher's along the policy's trajectory using a standard $\ell_2$ flow matching loss. By simply mimicking the teacher's behavior, $\pi$-Flow enables stable and scalable training and avoids the quality-diversity trade-off. On ImageNet 256$^2$, it attains a 1-NFE FID of 2.85, outperforming MeanFlow of the same DiT architecture. On FLUX.1-12B and Qwen-Image-20B at 4 NFEs, $\pi$-Flow achieves substantially better diversity than state-of-the-art few-step methods, while maintaining teacher-level quality.",cs,LG,2025,How can policy-based flow models improve the efficiency and quality of few-step generative modeling while addressing the quality-diversity trade-off inherent in traditional imitation distillation methods?
